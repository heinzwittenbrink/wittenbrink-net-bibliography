  {"id":"10.2307/20852680","abstract":"Der Aufsatz behandelt das Verhältnis von Journalismus und Geschichtsschreibung in vier Anläufen: In der älteren Zeitungstheorie sah man eine enge Verwandtschaft zwischen ihnen, war sich aber auch über ihre Unterschiede im Klaren. Eberhard Werner Happel ist das Beispiel für eine enge Verbindung von beidem auch in der Schreibpraxis. Im 19. Jahrhundert setzte eine Entfremdung zwischen Journalismus und Geschichtsschreibung ein. Dennoch gab es Historiker, die zumindest zeitweise als Journalisten arbeiteten. Nach einem Sprung in die Gegenwart werden an drei Beispielen - Joachim Fest, Johannes Willms und Volker Ullrich - die Beiträge von Journalisten zur Geschichtsschreibung dargestellt. Verfassten sie diese unter spezifisch »journalistischen« Prämissen? Darüber hinaus wird die historische Serie »Zeitläufte« der Wochenzeitschrift ›Die Zeit‹ daraufhin untersucht, welche historischen Themen darin in den letzten Jahren behandelt und wie diese bewertet wurden. Auch darin bestätigt sich Personalisierung als ein hoher historischer Nachrichtenwert. The article deals with the relationship between journalism and historiography in four steps: The early theorists of the newspaper perceived them to be adjacent although they saw also differences between them. Eberhard Werner Happel represents the connection of both in practical writing. In the 19th century an estrangement began. Nevertheless there were historians, who worked at least for some time as journalists. Jumping into the present, Joachim Fest, Johannes Willms and Volker Ullrich are exemplary journalists who wrote contributions to historiography. Did they do this under specific »journalistic« premises? Additionally the historical series in the weekly ›Die Zeit‹ is analysed. The question here is which historical topics are dealt with and with which tendencies. Even here personalization serves as a historical news value.","author":[{"family":"Wilke","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"10.2307/20852680","container-title":"Jahrbuch für Kommunikationsgeschichte","ISSN":"14384485","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"5–24","publisher":"Franz Steiner Verlag","title":"Journalismus und Geschichtsschreibung","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20852680","volume":"11"},

Die soziologische und semiologische Lektüre eines Artikels über Neuroendokrinologie zeigt die institutionellen Kennzeichen und die rhetorischen Vorkehrungen auf, die eine solche Anerkennung möglichmachen ; Der Stil eines solchen Artikels ist nicht kalt und unpersönlich, sondern polemisch : das Ziel ist es, andere Autoren aus ihrer dominierenden Stellung zu verdrängen, indem man ihre Aussagen modifiziert und sie zu unbegründeten Annahmen reduziert ; man kann die Grenze einer Wissenschaft als jenen Ort defînieren, an dem jede Aussage ununterbrochen auf ihre experimentelle Begründung zurückgeführt wird, um die Gegner zu disqualifizieren ; diese Vorgangsweise ist unter der Bedingung erfolgversprechend, dass der Autor genügend Ansehen akkumuliert hat, um seine Fachkollegen überzeugen zu können : in der Analyse der wissenschaftlichen Rhetorik geht es darum, die in Artikeln angewandten Formen linguistischer Kompetenz darzustellen, und so zur Analyse der Wissenschaft vom Gesischtspunkt einer allgmeinen Kreditwirtschaft aus (Ansehen, wirtschaftliches Kapital, theoretisches Kapital) beizutragen.","author":[{"family":"Fabbri","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"125770","DOI":"10.3406/arss.1977.3496","ISSN":"0335-5322","issued":{"date-parts":[[1977]]},"language":"fre","title":"La rhétorique de la science - pouvoir et devoir dans un article de science exacte","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.persee.fr/doc/arss_0335-5322_1977_num_13_1_3496"},

  {"id":"abramConnectionsClimateChange2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The 2019/20 Black Summer bushfire disaster in southeast Australia was unprecedented: the extensive area of forest burnt, the radiative power of the fires, and the extraordinary number of fires that developed into extreme pyroconvective events were all unmatched in the historical record. Australia’s hottest and driest year on record, 2019, was characterised by exceptionally dry fuel loads that primed the landscape to burn when exposed to dangerous fire weather and ignition. The combination of climate variability and long-term climate trends generated the climate extremes experienced in 2019, and the compounding effects of two or more modes of climate variability in their fire-promoting phases (as occurred in 2019) has historically increased the chances of large forest fires occurring in southeast Australia. Palaeoclimate evidence also demonstrates that fire-promoting phases of tropical Pacific and Indian ocean variability are now unusually frequent compared with natural variability in pre-industrial times. Indicators of forest fire danger in southeast Australia have already emerged outside of the range of historical experience, suggesting that projections made more than a decade ago that increases in climate-driven fire risk would be detectable by 2020, have indeed eventuated. The multiple climate change contributors to fire risk in southeast Australia, as well as the observed non-linear escalation of fire extent and intensity, raise the likelihood that fire events may continue to rapidly intensify in the future. Improving local and national adaptation measures while also pursuing ambitious global climate change mitigation efforts would provide the best strategy for limiting further increases in fire risk in southeast Australia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Abram","given":"Nerilie J."},{"family":"Henley","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Sen Gupta","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Lippmann","given":"Tanya J.

  {"id":"aguAGU21PressConference2021","abstract":"Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier is the largest fast-changing glacier in the world. It is thinning rapidly, has already retreated over eight miles, and has doubled in speed, in the last five decades. The vulnerable glacier is the size of Florida, and if it melts, global sea levels could rise by nearly 10 feet—putting millions of people living in coastal cities in danger zones for extreme flooding. Join experts from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration as they explore questions such as: Why is the glacier weakening? How soon before it begins its rapid collapse and accelerates sea level rise? And what can be done to slow its collapse?\n\nPanelists:\n\nTed Scambos, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)\nErin Pettit, Oregon State University\nPeter Washam, Cornell University\nPeter Davis, British Antarctic Survey\nLizzy Clyne, Lewis and Clark College\nAnna Crawford, University of St Andrews\n\nPlease visit https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting/Page... for more press materials and information from #AGU21.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,30]]},"citation-key":"aguAGU21PressConference2021","dimensions":"1:07:26","director":[{"literal":"AGU"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,13]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"#AGU21 Press Conference: The Threat from Thwaites: The retreat of Antarctica’s riskiest glacier","title-short":"#AGU21 Press Conference","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbgWsR4-aw"},

While data on the global impacts of climate change is available, those at regional levels are scanty and scattered. This prompted this study that took a general overview of climate change impacts in Nigeria. Mean annual and monthly temperature and rainfall data were collected from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and some States’ airports for a period of 105 years (1901-2005). Published data from different sources as acknowledged in the text were also used. Histogram, trendline and time series were the statistical tools employed to analyse the data. The results show that while temperature increased by 1.1OC for the 105 years, rainfall decreased by 81 mm. Desert encroachment, coastal inundations, drying up of surface waters and shift in crops cultivated over time were also noticed. Greenhouse gas reduction and adaptive measures were recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Akpodiogaga-a","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Odjugo","given":"Ovuyovwiroye"}],"citation-key":"akpodiogaga-aGeneralOverviewClimate2010","container-title":"Journal of Human Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Human Ecology","DOI":"10.1080/09709274.2010.11906248","ISSN":"0970-9274","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1]]},"language":"en","page":"47-55","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"General Overview of Climate Change Impacts in Nigeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09709274.2010.11906248","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"andraeNewPerspectivesInternet2020","abstract":"The main problems with several existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) power footprint investigations are: too limited (geographical and temporal) system boundary, overestimation of power saving potential in the next decade, assume that historical power use can predict future global power use in the next decade despite unprecedented data trafﬁc growth, assume that Mooret’s law relation to digital circuitry can continue \"forever\" and that no problems with extra cooling power will occur for several decades. The highly variable outlooks for the future power consumptions depend on \"starting values\", disruptions, regional differences and perceptual estimations of electricity intensity reductions and data trafﬁc increase. A hugely optimistic scenario - which takes into account 20% annual improvement of the J/bit in data centers and networks until 2030 is presented. However, the electric power consumption of the present ICT scope will be signiﬁcant unless great efforts are put into power saving features enabling such improvements of J/bit. Despite evident risks, it seems though that planned power saving measures and innovation will be able to keep the electricity consumption of ICT and the World under some kind of control. The major conclusion is based on several simulations in the present study - that future consumer ICT infrastructure cannot slow its overall electricity use until 2030 and it will use more than today.

  {"id":"andraeNewPerspectivesInternet2020a","abstract":"The main problems with several existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) power footprint investigations are: too limited (geographical and temporal) system boundary, overestimation of power saving potential in the next decade, assume that historical power use can predict future global power use in the next decade despite unprecedented data trafﬁc growth, assume that Mooret’s law relation to digital circuitry can continue \"forever\" and that no problems with extra cooling power will occur for several decades. The highly variable outlooks for the future power consumptions depend on \"starting values\", disruptions, regional differences and perceptual estimations of electricity intensity reductions and data trafﬁc increase. A hugely optimistic scenario - which takes into account 20% annual improvement of the J/bit in data centers and networks until 2030 is presented. However, the electric power consumption of the present ICT scope will be signiﬁcant unless great efforts are put into power saving features enabling such improvements of J/bit. Despite evident risks, it seems though that planned power saving measures and innovation will be able to keep the electricity consumption of ICT and the World under some kind of control. The major conclusion is based on several simulations in the present study - that future consumer ICT infrastructure cannot slow its overall electricity use until 2030 and it will use more than today. Data trafﬁc may not be the best proxy metric for estimating computing electricity. Operations and J/operation seem more promising for forecasting and scaling of bottom-up models.","author":[{"family":"Andrae","given":"Anders S G"}],"citation-key":"andraeNewPerspectivesInternet2020a","DOI":"DOI:10.30538/PSRP-EASL2020.0038","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"New perspectives on internet electricity use in 2030","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pisrt.org/psrpress/j/easl/2020/2/3/new-perspectives-on-internet-electricity-use-in-2030.pdf"},
  {"id":"andraePrecisionStreamlinedLife2017","abstract":"There is a lack of prescribed databases and approaches in place for performing comparable Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of smartphones and other electronic devices in a coherent manner. Hence there is a need within certain eco-rating initiatives for simpliﬁed, yet still precise enough, approaches that are expert independent. Here, ﬁve independently published Full LCAs (FLCA) of smartphones—and a metal content declaration of a tablet—are analyzed and compared with the simpliﬁed LCA method (Open Eco Rating LCA, OLCA) used by the open eco rating (OER) sustainability assessment. OLCA is described in detail. The comparisons use the same characterization factors that are used for climate change and abiotic resource depletion (ARD) midpoint impact categories. The tablet is only analyzed for the ARD indicator (ARDI). The results show that the difference between the FLCAs and the OLCA is up to 20% for the Global Warming Potential indicator (GWPI). The difference is explained by signiﬁcantly different emission intensities used in FLCAs and OLCA, especially for integrated circuit and screen production. The life cycle use of metals relevant for ARDI is identiﬁed in one of the FLCAs of mobile phones, and used in OLCA and compared with the corresponding FLCA ARDI score. The total FLCA ARDI score is 67% (2.0 vs. 1.2 grams Sb—eq.) and 32% (4.98 vs. 3.76 grams Sb—eq.) higher than OLCA ARDI for the mobile phone and the tablet, respectively. The reason is that OLCA only captures a few of the most relevant metals (gold, silver, tin, indium, and tantalum) for the ARDI. However, cobalt—and to some degree copper and lithium—are signiﬁcant gaps in the OLCA. The conclusion is that OLCA is an efﬁcient and fair approach for LCAs that are focused on the GWPI of smartphones as the divergence to FLCA can easily be explained. However, the circular footprint formulae, renewable electricity options, and ARD characterization indices for cobalt, copper and lithium should be added to OLCA for further precision. The next step is to compare the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) FLCA method with OLCA for GWPI and ARDI evaluations of new smartphones. Moreover, the effect of adding more midpoint or single score indicators could be tested in OLCA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrae","given":"Anders S.

  {"id":"andrewsCircularEconomyData2021","abstract":"The data centre industry (DCI) has grown from zero in the 1980s, to enabling 60% of the global population to be connected in 2021 via 7.2 million data centres. The DCI is based on a linear economy and there is an urgent need to transform to a Circular Economy to establish a secure supply chain and ensure an economically stable and uninterrupted service, which is particularly difficult in an industry that is comprised of ten insular subsectors. This paper describes the CEDaCI project which was established to address the challenge in this unique sector; this ground-breaking project employs a whole systems approach, Design Thinking and the Double Diamond methods, which rely on people/stakeholder engagement throughout. The paper reviews and assesses the impact of these methods and project to date, using quantitative and qualitative research, via an online sectoral survey and interviews with nine data centre and IT industry experts. The results show that the project is creating positive impact and initiating change across the sector and that the innovative output (designs, business models, and a digital tool) will ensure that sectoral transformation continues; the project methods and structure will also serve as an exemplar for other sectors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrews","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Newton","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Adibi","given":"Naeem"},{"family":"Chenadec","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Bienge","given":"Katrin"}],"citation-key":"andrewsCircularEconomyData2021","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su13116319","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","page":"6319","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Circular Economy for the Data Centre Industry: Using Design Methods to Address the Challenge of Whole System Sustainability in a Unique Industrial Sector","title-short":"A Circular Economy for the Data Centre Industry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6319","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"angenotSemioticsFaceFace2018","abstract":"This article aims to challenge and reflect on the theories issued by both textualist semiotics and the semiotics of practices. Our reflexion shall focus, on the one hand, on synchronic communication in copresence and, on the other hand, on virtual participative remote collaboration by means of digital interfaces. In high-level collaborative activities —such as remote architectural project developments— the practices of the partners involved in the communication process are conditioned by intrinsic material constraints; they have to gradually readapt to the constantly renewed dynamics of the predicative structures in order to ensure communication efficiency.One of the main purposes of this paper consists in exploring the theoretical propositions and methodologies connected to practices, as proposed by Jacques Fontanille’s semiotics (2008) and by Jacques Theureau’s ergonomics of the “course of action” (2006). The results of these theoretical reflections will be tested through their application to a specific corpus, in an aim to confront the efficiency of such proposals with a case study. Multimodality and the role played by the different types of utterances in the efficiency of communication, as well as the adaptation of the semiotic practices to the digital interfaces also fall under the scope of this paper. Besides, the authors propose a reflection on potential mediations between the ongoing practices and their objectivation through textualisation and notation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Angenot","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Shirkhodaei","given":"Shima"},{"family":"Dondero","given":"Maria Giulia"},{"family":"Joachim","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"angenotSemioticsFaceFace2018","container-title":"Interfaces numériques","DOI":"10.25965/INTERFACES-NUMERIQUES.2146","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]]},"language":"fr","medium":"text/html,application/PDF","page":"986ko","publisher":"Université de Limoges","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Semiotics of face to face and remote communication.

  {"id":"ankarlooUsingKarlPolanyi","abstract":"This paper forms a critique of the New Institutional Economics (NIE) of Douglass North, Ronald Coase, Oliver Williamson et al. from the viewpoint of Karl Polanyi’s thoughts on markets and capitalism. Contrasting the two approaches to one another, I argue that in their views of markets the two approaches are inherently and fundamentally dissimilar. Polanyi’s approach sustains the idea of a history of different market forms, the idea that qualitatively different economic systems have prevailed in human history and that market capitalism is a latter-day product of history, brought about by a “great transformation” in human societal existence. Thereby Polanyi’s conception is potentially historical, social and realistic. NIE on the other hand, although it was once conceived in recognition of the problems of the lack of history, sociality and realism in orthodox economic theory, cannot overcome these problems pinpointed by (among others) Polanyi. Hence, contrary to the promise of above all North, NIE remains ahistorical, asocial and non-realistic in its approach. This is so, because with its focus on the market as a universal yardstick, used in order to explain all other institutions, NIE cannot fully allow for a history of different market forms, nor can NIE conceive of the capitalist market system as the product of history, but tends rather to see the market as the very beginning as well as the end of human history. The paper concludes that in light of the continuing influence and spread of NIE, Polanyi remains a valuable and necessary corrective to this “economistic fallacy” of old, in its new disguise.","author":[{"family":"Ankarloo","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"ankarlooUsingKarlPolanyi","language":"en","page":"25","source":"Zotero","title":"Using Karl Polanyi as a stepping stone for a critique of the new institutionalist orthodoxy","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"apicellaSocialNetworksCooperation2012","abstract":"Social networks show striking structural regularities, and both theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the development of large-scale cooperation in humans. Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extendsup to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate. Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Apicella","given":"Coren L."},{"family":"Marlowe","given":"Frank W."},{"family":"Fowler","given":"James H."},{"family":"Christakis","given":"Nicholas A."}],"citation-key":"apicellaSocialNetworksCooperation2012","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature10736","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7382","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,25]]},"page":"497–501","source":"CrossRef","title":"Social networks and cooperation in hunter-gatherers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10736","volume":"481"},

  {"id":"barcaForcesReproductionNotes2020","abstract":"The concept of Anthropocene has been incorporated within a hegemonic narrative that represents ‘Man’ as the dominant geological force of our epoch, emphasizing the destruction and salvation power of industrial technologies. This Element develops a counter-hegemonic narrative based on the perspective of earthcare labour– or the ‘forces of reproduction’. It brings to the fore the historical agency of reproductive and subsistence workers as those subjects that, through both daily practices and organized political action, take care of the biophysical conditions for human reproduction, thus keeping the world alive. Adopting a narrative justice approach, and placing feminist political ecology right at the core of its critique of the Anthropocene storyline, this Element oﬀers a novel and timely contribution to the Environmental Humanities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Barca","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"barcaForcesReproductionNotes2020","DOI":"10.1017/9781108878371","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-108-87837-1 978-1-108-81395-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Forces of Reproduction: Notes for a Counter-Hegemonic Anthropocene","title-short":"Forces of Reproduction","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108878371/type/element"},

  {"id":"bernauBrunoLatourLoving2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            In An Inquiry into the Modes of Existence, which addresses itself to the profound challenge of how to “compose” a common world in the Anthropocene, Bruno Latour proposes that the mode of religion [REL] offers a model for all the others—that of reprise. Emerging from the practice of biblical exegesis, reprise refers to an open-ended process of meaning making opposed to the rigid certainties of fundamentalism. [REL] also contributes a concept of radical transformation through love (“conversion”). For Latour, two events from the Virgin Mary’s life—the Annunciation and the Assumption—illustrate reprise and conversion, both of which are necessary in coming to terms with monogeism, the knowledge that there is only one world. This essay examines Latour’s proposed relationship between reprise and conversion through a consideration of late medieval Marian devotion. Focusing on vernacular accounts of Mary’s Assumption, it argues that reprise leads to violent as well as loving conversions; indeed, violence can proceed in the name of love. The essay concludes that composition, reprise, and conversion come together in ways that trouble late medieval accounts of the Assumption, the mode of religion, and life in the Anthropocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernau","given":"Anke"}],"citation-key":"bernauBrunoLatourLoving2020","container-title":"Romanic Review","DOI":"10.1215/00358118-8007992","ISSN":"0035-8118, 2688-5220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"151-172","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bruno Latour and the Loving Assumptions of [REL]","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/romanic-review/article/111/1/151/164260/Bruno-Latour-and-the-Loving-Assumptions-of-REL","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"borchersTransformationMedienMedien2021","abstract":"Public Relations werden üblicherweise auf der Ebene von Organisationen beschrieben. Eine gesellschaftliche Perspektive ist selten, hat aber eine gewisse Tradition. Beispielhaft zu nennen wären der Ansatz der verständigungsorientierten Öffentlichkeitsarbeit von Roland Burkart (1992), aber auch einzelne Handlungsfelder wie zum Beispiel öffentlich getragene Gesundheitskampagnen. In diesen Bereichen zielt PR nicht auf die Vertretung von Einzelinteressen ab, sondern auf gesellschaftliche Lösungen. Dieser Beitrag diskutiert, welche Rolle PR-Forschung und -Praxis in gesellschaftlichen Veränderungsprozessen spielen können. Konkret geht es um Bezugspunkte zwischen PR und einer transformativen Wissenschaft sowie damit verbunden um einen möglichen Beitrag der PR hin zu einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"citation-key":"borchersTransformationMedienMedien2021","DOI":"10.53291/GFNG8688","editor":[{"family":"Borchers","given":"Nils S."},{"family":"Güney","given":"Selma"},{"family":"Krüger","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Schamgerger","given":"Kerem"}],"ISBN":"978-3-86489-340-7 978-3-86489-845-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,19]]},"language":"de","publisher":"Westend Verlag","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transformation der Medien – Medien der Transformation: Verhandlungen des Netzwerks Kritische Kommunikationswissenschaft","title-short":"Transformation der Medien – Medien der Transformation","type":"book","URL":"https://www.westendverlag.de/OA/10.53291GFNG8688%20Krueger_Transformation_Gesamt.pdf"},

  {"id":"bradburyLearningActorNetwork2014","abstract":"This paper explores how an alternative understanding of the development ofscientific knowledge through the work of Bruno Latour can help to bridge the gapbetween knowledge produced through practice-based research and conventionalresearch outputs.The paper reviews the history of the debate of what constitutes practice-basedresearch outputs drawing from the work of Frayling (1993) and Archer (1995). Anunderstanding of practice-based research is developed that goes beyond a simplisticview of a building or artefact as a research output or “mute object” (Till 2012).This is considered in the context of the work of Bruno Latour (1987, 2005) and otherswho have tried to show how the construction of scientific facts is produced as afunction of both the ‘objects’ and ‘social’ context of science.Through reviewing practice-based research submissions from RAE 2008 the paperexplores how we may re-conceive both the normative models of research outputs(peer reviewed academic papers) and the products of architecture practice (buildingsand artefacts) and conceive them both as part of the same network of knowledgeproduction. This is then discussed in the practical context of a practice-based research project into low energy housing.In doing so the paper suggest this new understanding will elevate the importance ofrigorous practice-based research while overcoming the challenges faced inconventional research in the constant desire to show impact from research projects.","author":[{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"bradburyLearningActorNetwork2014","container-title":"Revista Lusófona de Arquitectura e Educação","ISSN":"1646-6756","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"453-470","title":"Learning from Actor Network Theory: Bridging the gap between research in science and research by design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://revistas.ulusofona.pt/index.php/revlae/article/view/4783","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"bradshawUnderestimatingChallengesAvoiding2021","abstract":"We report three major and confronting environmental issues that have received little attention and require urgent action. First, we review the evidence that future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms—including humanity—is in fact so great that it is difﬁcult to grasp for even well-informed experts. Second, we ask what political or economic system, or leadership, is prepared to handle the predicted disasters, or even capable of such action. Third, this dire situation places an extraordinary responsibility on scientists to speak out candidly and accurately when engaging with government, business, and the public. We especially draw attention to the lack of appreciation of the enormous challenges to creating a sustainable future. The added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends. The science underlying these issues is strong, but awareness is weak. Without fully appreciating and broadcasting the scale of the problems and the enormity of the solutions required, society will fail to achieve even modest sustainability goals.","author":[{"family":"Bradshaw","given":"Corey J A"}],"citation-key":"bradshawUnderestimatingChallengesAvoiding2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Underestimating the Challenges of Avoiding a Ghastly Future","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"brandDegrowthUndPostExtraktivismus2015","abstract":"There are at the moment two lines of discussion in Europe and Latin America in which current and prominent critiques of the dominant developments and alternatives are condensed and which could come to function as future orientation: the discussion on degrowth in Southern and Western Europe and the one on postextractivism in Latin America. Surprisingly, the two perspectives are hardly ever related with one another. But the chances of realizing a degrowth perspective as well as alternatives to extractivism will very much depend on changing international political, socio-economic and cultural conditions. The text outlines the different contemporary historical contexts in both regions, briefly introduces the main elements of degrowth and post-extractivism and intends to make both perspectives resonant with each other. This way, the paper wants to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective and to enable further discussion and precisions. The last part formulates open questions for both lines of discussion.","author":[{"family":"Brand","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"brandDegrowthUndPostExtraktivismus2015","event-place":"Jena","ISBN":"ISSN 2194-136X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"de","publisher-place":"Jena","source":"Zotero","title":"Degrowth und Post-Extraktivismus: Zwei Seiten einer Medaille?

  {"id":"brandHowGetOut","abstract":"The concept of transformation has become a buzzword within the last few years. This has to do, first, with the ever broader recognition of the profound character of the environmental crisis, secondly, with increasingly obvious limits to existing forms of (global) environmental governance, thirdly, with the emergence of other dimensions of the crisis since 2008 and, fourthly, with intensified debates about required profound social change, especially of societal nature relations. However, the term transformation itself is contested. It largely depends on theoretical assumptions as well as the plausibility and applicability of the arguments which are made. In this paper, a historical-materialist approach to social-ecological transformation is outlined by referring to a theoretically sophisticated understanding of ‘subject(s)’ of transformation as well as the ‘object(s)’ of what is to be transformed. Theoretical concepts like the capitalist mode of production, regulation and hegemony, a critical understanding of the state and governance as well as the term societal nature relations are key. Such a perspective contributes to a more sophisticated understanding of the obstacles and requirements of real-world transformation. Finally, the argument has implications for visions and strategies, i.e., an emancipatory and democratic shaping of social relations and societal nature relations.","author":[{"family":"Brand","given":"Ulrich"}],"citation-key":"brandHowGetOut","container-title":"Environmental Values","language":"en","page":"24","source":"Zotero","title":"How to Get Out of the Multiple Crisis?

We argue that no ﬁxed spatial or temporal level is appropriate for governing ecosystems and their services sustainably, effectively, and equitably.

  {"id":"burgessIPCCBaselineScenarios","abstract":"Scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are central to climate science and policy. Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya Identity factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to “baseline” scenario projections from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2 emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth—predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence from baselines in IEA’s projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of: headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios. Our analyses inform the rapidly evolving discussions on climate and development futures, and on uses of scenarios in climate science and policy.","author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Matthew G"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Shapland","given":"John"},{"family":"Jr","given":"Roger Pielke"}],"citation-key":"burgessIPCCBaselineScenarios","language":"en","page":"27","source":"Zotero","title":"IPCC baseline scenarios have over-projected CO2 emissions and economic growth","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"burkePlioceneEoceneProvide2018","abstract":"As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129–116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 (<1%) but reach 8.7% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Burke","given":"K.

  {"id":"ClimateChangeKenya2021","abstract":"Climate change in Kenya is increasingly impacting the lives of Kenya's citizens and the environment. Climate change has led to more frequent extreme weather events like droughts which last longer than usual, irregular and unpredictable rainfall, flooding and increasing temperatures. The effects of these climatic changes have made already existing challenges with water security, food security  and economic growth even more difficult. Harvests and agricultural production which account for about 33% of total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are also at risk. The increased temperatures, rainfall variability in arid and semi-arid areas, and strong winds associated with tropical cyclones have combined to create favorable conditions for the breeding and migration of pests. An increase in temperature of up to 2.5°C by 2050 is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme events such as floods and droughts.Hot and dry conditions in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) make droughts or flooding brought on by extreme weather changes even more dangerous.

  {"id":"climateresearchboardnationalacademyofsciencesCarbonDioxideClimate1979","abstract":"At the request of President Carter’s Executive Office, the National Academy of Sciences convened the Climate Research Board to assess the scientific basis for “future climatic changes resulting from man-made releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.” The study concludes that at the present rate of carbon emissions the global surface will warm 2 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. Further, after studying radiative heating, cloud effects, and ocean heat transport, they were “unable to find any overlooked or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the currently estimated global warming…”\n\nThe report begins by discussing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. They note an increase of 20 ppm of carbon from 1958 to 1979. The group warns that if all present fossil fuel reserves were used for combustion it would increase the airborne proportion of carbon dioxide by 30% to 50%. Hoping to find a process that would mitigate carbon emissions, the report delves into the relationship between earth’s natural cycles and the heightened carbon dioxide content. For instance, they discuss the change on earth’s albedo effect because of melting ice caps. A decrease in land covered by snow lowers the mean global albedo and, in turn, increases the earth’s absorption of solar radiation. The report also points to increased water vapor which could increase the globe’s temperature by 2 degrees Celsius. Lastly, positive and negative feedback systems are discussed in relation to cloud cover and ocean layering. In both instances, there are circumstances that could accelerate or decelerate the effects of global climate change that require more analysis and data collection.\n\nOverall, this is another example of how early scientists, politicians, and industry groups were presented with evidence of both the effects of carbon dioxide on the environment and humanity’s role in the atmospheric increase. While this report concedes to certain uncertainties, they have enough data to conclude that, at this rate, carbon dioxide content will be doubled by 2030 and that the earth’s climate will change drastically.\n\n(http://www.climatefiles.com/climate-change-evidence/1979-report-carbon-dioxide-climate/)","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Climate Research Board, National Academy of Sciences","given":""}],"citation-key":"climateresearchboardnationalacademyofsciencesCarbonDioxideClimate1979","event-place":"Woods Hole","issued":{"date-parts":[[1979,7,23],[27]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Woods Hole","source":"Zotero","title":"Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment","type":"report","URL":"https://www.bnl.gov/envsci/schwartz/charney_report1979.pdf"},

  {"id":"cowieSixthMassExtinction","abstract":"There have been five Mass Extinction events in the history of Earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) of all 2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cowie","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Bouchet","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Fontaine","given":"Benoît"}],"citation-key":"cowieSixthMassExtinction","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12816","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Sixth Mass Extinction: fact, fiction or speculation?","title-short":"The Sixth Mass Extinction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12816","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"creutzigTechnologyDemandSideSolutions2016","abstract":"The assessment literature on climate change solutions to date has emphasized technologies and options based on cost-effectiveness analysis. However, many solutions to climate change mitigation misalign with such analytical frameworks. Here, we examine demand-side solutions, a crucial class of mitigation options that go beyond technological speciﬁcation and costbeneﬁt analysis. To do so, we synthesize demand-side mitigation options in the urban, building, transport, and agricultural sectors. We also highlight the speciﬁc nature of demand-side solutions in the context of development. We then discuss key analytical considerations to integrate demand-side options into overarching assessments on mitigation. Such a framework would include infrastructure solutions that interact with endogenous preference formation. Both hard infrastructures, such as the built environment, and soft infrastructures, such as habits and norms, shape behavior and as a consequence offer signiﬁcant potential for reducing overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that systemic infrastructural and behavioral change will likely be a necessary component of a transition to a low-carbon society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Creutzig","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Blanca"},{"family":"Haberl","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Khosla","given":"Radhika"},{"family":"Mulugetta","given":"Yacob"},{"family":"Seto","given":"Karen C."}],"citation-key":"creutzigTechnologyDemandSideSolutions2016","container-title":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","container-title-short":"Annu.

For this purpose, we developa dynamic macrosimulation model of the Italian economy which explores the social and structuraleffects of the Italian integrated policyplan for energy and climate. We find that green growth alonewill not result in better societal conditions andneeds  to  be  compensated  with  social  policies  to  reduceinequality.  Hence,  we  select  two  social  policies,namely a basic income programme and a working timereduction policy, that are expected to deliver similarresults in terms of redistribution and comparetheir environmental outcomes in terms of CO2 emissions. Ourscenario  analysis  shows  that  workingtime  reductionleads  to  an  increase  in  employment  and  a  paralleldecrease in aggregate demand thatcause both a reduction in emissions and inequality. On the other hand, thebasic  income  programmereduces  inequality  by  sustaining  aggregate  demand,  which  in  turn  reduces thepositive environmentaleffects of the energy plan.","author":[{"family":"D'Alessandro","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Cieplinski","given":"André"},{"family":"Guarnieri","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Distefano, Tiziano","given":""}],"citation-key":"dalessandroCouplingEnvironmentalTransition2020","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"publisher":"Discussion Papers del Dipartimento di Scienze Economiche –Università di Pisa, n. 256","title":"Coupling environmental transition and social prosperity:a scenario-analysis of the Italian case.","type":"document","URL":"http://www-dse.ec.unipi.it/ricerca/discussion-papers.htm"},

Those who write about degrowth advocate radical policy and social change, but have no model to explain how, why and under what conditions such change could come about and what role the state would play in it. This is because they have no theory of what the state is, or when and why it changes. We review for the ﬁrst time the Anglophone and Francophone literatures on state and degrowth and ﬁnd both wanting. We propose a Gramscian theory of the state suitable for thinking about degrowth and show with the example of strategizing for a maximum income policy how this suits the degrowth literature’s emphasis on a combination of grassroots and institutional actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"D’Alisa","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Kallis","given":"Giorgos"}],"citation-key":"dalisaDegrowthState2020","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106486","ISSN":"09218009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","page":"106486","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Degrowth and the State","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092180091831749X","volume":"169"},
  {"id":"daltonZenCopingClimate","abstract":"More and more of us are seriously worrying about what we’ve done to the earth’s climate. But while climate predictions can be scary, Sister True Dedication says we don’t have to live in a place of fear or denial. \n\n \n\n“We all need a real practice to be able to not be afraid of our fear and not be afraid of our despair and anxiety and to learn some really concrete practices to be able to acknowledge it, and recognize it and embrace it every time it comes up,” she says.\n\n \n\nIn fact, the Zen Buddhist nun says accepting and even leaning into these difficult feelings can make us stronger and more ready to act.\n\nSister True Dedication is editor of internationally renowned Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh’s latest book, Zen and the Art of Saving The Planet. She says while the climate crisis is urgent, living in a constantly reactive state is unhealthy and doesn’t help us take action. But there are approaches that can help: \n\n“The power of Zen and the power of mindfulness is that it roots this in the present moment so we can be alert to what is going on, we can be responsive, we can be the master of our mind and awareness in any given situation,” she says. “So, we can really have the present moment as the ground for our urgent action and that is action taken with clarity, with courage, with solidity, with freedom, and not with panic.”\n\nShe offers simple guidance for someone interested in beginning a mindfulness practice: take some time for yourself, outside in nature if possible, and relax your body with mindful breathing. \n\n“And then just take time to listen,” Sister True Dedication says. “Say we’re out and sitting underneath a tree, just to listen to the birds and if we’re listening to the birds, we know we’re in the present moment. We know we’re alive, we know we are in touch with the miracle of life.”\n\nPsychotherapist Leslie Davenport is author of several books, including Emotional Resiliency in the Era of Climate Change. Her new book, All the Feelings Under the Sun: How to Deal With Climate Change, is targeted at middle-school kids and guides them through exercises designed to build their emotional resilience. \n\nDavenport says many kids struggle with climate anxiety and grief, particularly as they get into high school and early college. \n\n“It's the time in life when you look to the future. Do I want to get married, what kind of relationship would I want, what's my career path, what do I dream and envision my life might look like? And that’s where the youth today are really feeling the climate anxiety and the climate grief because they are tuned in to the scientific projections about what could unfurl, especially without significant and immediate action,” she says.\n\nDavenport says there’s a tremendous need to support our youth, not only in the 16 to 24 age range but also younger children her book is targeted at, to help them develop emotional resilience tools to be prepared for those feelings they’ll encounter as they grow. \n\nDavenport suggests parents and caregivers first take care of their own emotions, so they can model strength and resilience for their children. And then when supporting children:\n\n“Make room for and welcome the feelings. Validate that the feelings are there because you care, because you're paying attention, because it is distressing what's happening to the environment and people and our biosphere as a whole.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]]},"citation-key":"daltonZenCopingClimate","collection-title":"climate one","dimensions":"51'33''","director":[{"family":"Dalton","given":"Greg"}],"language":"en","title":"Zen and Coping with Climate","type":"broadcast","URL":"https://www.climateone.org/audio/zen-and-coping-climate#"},

  {"id":"danowskiEndsWorld2016","abstract":"\"The end of the world is a seemingly interminable topic; at least, of course, until it happens. Environmental catastrophe and planetary apocalypse are subjects of enduring fascination and, as ethnographic studies show, human cultures have approached them in very different ways. Indeed, in the face of the growing perception of the dire effects of global warming, some of these visions have been given a new lease on life. Information and analyses concerning the human causes and the catastrophic consequences of the planetary crisis have been accumulating at an ever-increasing rate, mobilising popular opinion as well as academic reflection. In this book, philosopher Deborah Danowski and anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro offer a bold overview and interpretation of these current discourses on the end of the world, reading them as thought experiments on the decline of the West's anthropological adventure; that is, as attempts, though not necessarily intentional ones, at inventing a mythology that is adequate to the present. This work has important implications for the future development of ecological practices and it will appeal to a broad audience interested in contemporary anthropology, philosophy, and environmentalism\"--","author":[{"family":"Danowski","given":"Déborah"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Eduardo Batalha Viveiros","dropping-particle":"de"}],"call-number":"BL503","citation-key":"danowskiEndsWorld2016","event-place":"Malden, MA","ISBN":"978-1-5095-0401-5 978-1-5095-0400-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Polity","publisher-place":"Malden, MA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The ends of the world","type":"book"},

  {"id":"delavegaAtmosphericCO2MidPiacenzian2020","abstract":"The Piacenzian stage of the Pliocene (2.6 to 3.6 Ma) is the most recent past interval of sustained global warmth with mean global temperatures markedly higher (by ~2–3 °C) than today. Quantifying CO2 levels during the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (mPWP) provides a means, therefore, to deepen our understanding of Earth System behaviour in a warm climate state. Here we present a new high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 using the δ11B-pH proxy from 3.35 to 3.15 million years ago (Ma) at a temporal resolution of 1 sample per 3–6 thousand years (kyrs). Our study interval covers both the coolest marine isotope stage of the mPWP, M2 (~3.3 Ma) and the transition into its warmest phase including interglacial KM5c (centered on ~3.205 Ma) which has a similar orbital configuration to present. We find that CO2 ranged from $${{\\bf{394}}}_{{\\boldsymbol{-}}{\\bf{9}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{+}}{\\bf{34}}}$$ppm to $${{\\bf{330}}}_{{\\boldsymbol{-}}{\\bf{21}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{+}}{\\bf{14}}}$$ppm: with CO2 during the KM5c interglacial being $${{\\bf{391}}}_{{\\boldsymbol{-}}{\\bf{28}}}^{{\\boldsymbol{+}}{\\bf{30}}}$$ppm (at 95% confidence). Our findings corroborate the idea that changes in atmospheric CO2 levels played a distinct role in climate variability during the mPWP.

The main goal of this chapter is to offer an introduction to UM. First, a brief history of UM is provided. Three different methods to perform an UM are then introduced: the ﬁrst method takes a bottom-up approach by collecting/estimating individual ﬂows; the second method takes a topdown approach by using nation-wide input–output data; and the third method takes a hybrid approach. Subsequently, to illustrate the process of applying UM, a practical case study is offered using the city-state of Singapore as an exemplar. Finally, current and future opportunities and challenges of UM are discussed. Overall, by the early twenty-ﬁrst century, the development and application of UM have been relatively slow, but this might change as more and better data sources become available and as the world strives to become more sustainable and resilient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Derrible","given":"Sybil"},{"family":"Cheah","given":"Lynette"},{"family":"Arora","given":"Mohit"},{"family":"Yeow","given":"Lih Wei"}],"citation-key":"derribleUrbanMetabolism2021","container-title":"Urban Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6_7","editor":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Wenzhong"},{"family":"Goodchild","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Batty","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kwan","given":"Mei-Po"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Anshu"}],"event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"9789811589829 9789811589836","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"85-114","publisher":"Springer Singapore","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urban Metabolism","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6_7"},

This suggests that a focus on the scientific and economic questions is too narrow, and the tendency to see the political problem as one of nation states facing a traditional tragedy of the commons is too optimistic.  Instead, we should recognize that climate change is an ethical problem that is genuinely global, dominantly intergenerational, and takes place in a setting where our prescriptive theories are weak.  This “perfect moral storm” is manifest in recent developments in international climate policy in the turmoil surrounding the Paris agreement. It also helps both to explain the worrying increase in moral corruption in the public sphere, and to predict new forms that such corruption may take.\n\nStephen M.

  {"id":"devriesBitcoinGrowingEwaste2021","abstract":"Bitcoin’s increasing energy consumption has triggered a passionate debate about the sustainability of the digital currency. And yet, most studies have thus far ignored that Bitcoin miners cycle through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate the growth in global electronic waste. E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin’s e-waste and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons per annum, per May 2021. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to mitigate Bitcoin’s growing e-waste problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vries","given":"Alex","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Stoll","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"devriesBitcoinGrowingEwaste2021","container-title":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","container-title-short":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","DOI":"10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901","ISSN":"09213449","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"language":"en","page":"105901","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921344921005103","volume":"175"},

  {"id":"diazPervasiveHumandrivenDecline2019","abstract":"The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature’s benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend—nature and its contributions to people—is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action.

  {"id":"diefirmagmbhDfiB2bom20132013","abstract":"Für den B2B Online-Monitor 2013 von Die Firma und Consultic wurden 216 Entscheider aus Marketing, Unternehmenskommunikation und Geschäftsleitung zu den Themenfeldern Kommunikationsstrategie und mobile Kommunikation befragt.\nDer B2B Online-Monitor 2013 erbrachte folgende zentrale Ergebnisse:\nNutzung und Erfolg der Online-Kommunikation\nOnline-Kommunikation hat eine Leitfunktion für alle Kommunikationsmaßnahmen übernommen. Klassi- sche Maßnahmen wie Website und Suchmaschinen- marketing haben sich auf einem hohen Level etabliert. Social Media haben sich zu einem wesentlichen Bau- stein innerhalb der Online-Kommunikation entwickelt, alle Kanäle nehmen in der Nutzung zu. Im Hinblick auf die Ziele, die mit Social Media verknüpft werden, zeigen die Unternehmen aber noch Unsicherheiten, die auch zu einer geringeren Erfolgsbewertung im Vergleich zu den etablierten Kanälen führen.\nMobile Kommunikation\nIm Bereich der mobilen Kommunikation sind Unsicher- heit und Unkenntnis der Unternehmen noch größer. Über den Einsatz von QR-Codes und mobilen Websites hinaus wird wenig getan. Entsprechend zurückhaltend sind die Unternehmen in der Einschätzung, welche Be- deutung der mobilen Kommunikation künftig zukommt. Die eine Hälfte stimmt der Aussage zu, dass mobile Kommunikation zukünftig ein entscheidender Erfolgs- faktor in den Kommunikationsmaßnahmen darstellen wird, die andere Hälfte stimmt dieser Aussage teilweise oder gar nicht zu. Ein Ergebnis, das nicht zur gesell- schaftlichen und technologischen Entwicklung passt.\nStrategie in der Online-Kommunikation\nDas strategische Vorgehen nimmt in der Wahrnehmung der Unternehmen an Bedeutung zu. Die entsprechen- de Umsetzung von Maßnahmen hinkt dem aber noch immer hinterher. Das zeigt auch die Untersuchung der Werkzeuge, die zur Analyse der Zielgruppen und ihrer Bedürfnisse eingesetzt werden.\nBudgetentwicklung\nDie Budgets für Online-Kommunikation sind für Un- ternehmen aller Größen in den vergangenen Jahren gestiegen. Der Anteil am Gesamtkommunikationsetat pendelt sich bei rund einem Viertel ein. Auch für die kommenden Jahre wird ein weiteres moderates Wachs- tum erwartet. Insgesamt passen die Budgets aber nicht zur Bedeutung, die der Online-Kommunikation angesichts der digitalen Transformation der Unternehmen zukommt.","citation-key":"diefirmagmbhDfiB2bom20132013","editor":[{"family":"Die Firma GmbH","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"title":"dfi_b2bom_2013_web.pdf","type":"document"},

  {"id":"dongesTaxonomiesStructuringModels2018","abstract":"Abstract. In the Anthropocene, social processes have become critical to understanding planetary-scale Earth system dynamics. The conceptual foundations of Earth system modelling have externalised social processes in ways that now hinder progress in understanding Earth resilience and informing governance of global environmental change. New approaches to global modelling are needed to address these challenges, but the current modelling landscape is highly diverse and heterogeneous, ranging from purely biophysical Earth System Models, to hybrid macro-economic Integrated Assessments Models, to a plethora of models of socio-cultural dynamics. World-Earth models, currently not yet available, will need to integrate all these elements, so future World-Earth modellers require a structured approach to identify, classify, select, and combine model components. Here, we develop taxonomies for ordering the multitude of societal and biophysical subsystems and their interactions. We suggest three taxa for modelled subsystems: (i) biophysical, where dynamics is usually represented by natural laws of physics, chemistry or ecology (i.e., the usual components of Earth system models), (ii) socio-cultural, dominated by processes of human behaviour, decision making and collective social dynamics (e.g., politics, institutions, social networks), and (iii) socio-metabolic, dealing with the material interactions of social and biophysical subsystems (e.g., human bodies, natural resource and agriculture). We show how higher-order taxonomies for interactions between two or more subsystems can be derived, highlighting the kinds of social-ecological feedback loops where new modelling efforts need to be directed. As an example, we apply the taxonomy to a stylised World-Earth system model of socially transmitted discount rates in a greenhouse gas emissions game to illustrate the effects of social-ecological feedback loops that are usually not considered in current modelling efforts. The proposed taxonomy can contribute to guiding the design and operational development of more comprehensive World-Earth models for understanding Earth resilience and charting sustainability transitions within planetary boundaries and other future trajectories in the Anthropocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."},{"family":"Lucht","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Heitzig","given":"Jobst"},{"family":"Barfuss","given":"Wolfram"},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Lade","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Schlüter","given":"Maja"}],"citation-key":"dongesTaxonomiesStructuringModels2018","DOI":"10.5194/esd-2018-27","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,26]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Dynamics of the Earth system: concepts","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Taxonomies for structuring models for World-Earth system analysisof the Anthropocene: subsystems, their interactions andsocial-ecological feedback loops","title-short":"Taxonomies for structuring models for World-Earth system analysisof the Anthropocene","type":"report","URL":"https://esd.copernicus.org/preprints/esd-2018-27/"},

  {"id":"drijfhoutCatalogueAbruptShifts2015","abstract":"Significance\n            One of the most concerning consequences of human-induced increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is the potential for rapid regional transitions in the climate system. Yet, despite much public awareness of how “tipping points” may be crossed, little information is available as to exactly what may be expected in the coming centuries. We assess all Earth System Models underpinning the recent 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and systematically search for evidence of abrupt changes. We do find abrupt changes in sea ice, oceanic flows, land ice, and terrestrial ecosystem response, although with little consistency among the models. A particularly large number is projected for warming levels below 2°. We discuss mechanisms and include methods to objectively classify abrupt climate change.\n          , \n            Abrupt transitions of regional climate in response to the gradual rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are notoriously difficult to foresee. However, such events could be particularly challenging in view of the capacity required for society and ecosystems to adapt to them. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic screening of the massive climate model ensemble informing the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, and reveal evidence of 37 forced regional abrupt changes in the ocean, sea ice, snow cover, permafrost, and terrestrial biosphere that arise after a certain global temperature increase. Eighteen out of 37 events occur for global warming levels of less than 2°, a threshold sometimes presented as a safe limit. Although most models predict one or more such events, any specific occurrence typically appears in only a few models. We find no compelling evidence for a general relation between the overall number of abrupt shifts and the level of global warming. However, we do note that abrupt changes in ocean circulation occur more often for moderate warming (less than 2°), whereas over land they occur more often for warming larger than 2°. Using a basic proportion test, however, we find that the number of abrupt shifts identified in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios is significantly larger than in other scenarios of lower radiative forcing. This suggests the potential for a gradual trend of destabilization of the climate with respect to such shifts, due to increasing global mean temperature change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Drijfhout","given":"Sybren"},{"family":"Bathiany","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Beaulieu","given":"Claudie"},{"family":"Brovkin","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Claussen","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Huntingford","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Sgubin","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Swingedouw","given":"Didier"}],"citation-key":"drijfhoutCatalogueAbruptShifts2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"duboisItStartsHome2019","abstract":"Through their consumption behavior, households are responsible for 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, they are key actors in reaching the 1.5 °C goal under the Paris Agreement. However, the possible contribution and position of households in climate policies is neither well understood, nor do households receive sufficiently high priority in current climate policy strategies. This paper investigates how behavioral change can achieve a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in European high-income countries. It uses theoretical thinking and some core results from the HOPE research project, which investigated household preferences for reducing emissions in four European cities in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. The paper makes five major points: First, car and plane mobility, meat and dairy consumption, as well as heating are the most dominant components of household footprints. Second, household living situations (demographics, size of home) greatly influence the household potential to reduce their footprint, even more than country or city location. Third, household decisions can be sequential and temporally dynamic, shifting through different phases such as childhood, adulthood, and illness. Fourth, short term voluntary efforts will not be sufficient by themselves to reach the drastic reductions needed to achieve the 1.5 °C goal; instead, households need a regulatory framework supporting their behavioral changes. Fifth, there is a mismatch between the roles and responsibilities conveyed by current climate policies and household perceptions of responsibility. We then conclude with further recommendations for research and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dubois","given":"Ghislain"},{"family":"Sovacool","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Aall","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Barbier","given":"Carine"},{"family":"Herrmann","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Bruyère","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Skold","given":"Bore"},{"family":"Nadaud","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Dorner","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Moberg","given":"Karen Richardsen"},{"family":"Ceron","given":"Jean Paul"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Dorothee"},{"family":"Baltruszewicz","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Benevise","given":"Françoise"},{"family":"Louis","given":"Valérie R."},{"family":"Sauerborn","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"duboisItStartsHome2019","container-title":"Energy Research & Social Science","container-title-short":"Energy Research & Social Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2019.02.001","ISSN":"22146296","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"language":"en","page":"144-158","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"It starts at home?

While the land sink currently mitigates ~30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions, it is unclear whether this ecosystem service will persist and, more specifically, what hard temperature limits, if any, regulate carbon uptake. Here, we use the largest continuous carbon flux monitoring network to construct the first observationally derived temperature response curves for global land carbon uptake. We show that the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (3-month period) passed the thermal maximum for photosynthesis during the past decade. At higher temperatures, respiration rates continue to rise in contrast to sharply declining rates of photosynthesis. Under business-as-usual emissions, this divergence elicits a near halving of the land sink strength by as early as 2040.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Katharyn A."},{"family":"Schwalm","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Arcus","given":"Vickery L."},{"family":"Koch","given":"George W."},{"family":"Liang","given":"Liyin L."},{"family":"Schipper","given":"Louis A."}],"citation-key":"duffyHowCloseAre2021","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci.

According to the general consensus, selfdevelopment practices thus produce various individual pathologies and reinforce the societal status quo. Using mindfulness meditation as an example, and by exploring how it was practiced by activists during Occupy Wall Street, the paper sets out to challenge this consensus and examine the possibility of progressive selfdevelopment practices. On this basis, we introduce Hartmut Rosa’s concept of resonance as a starting point for conceptualizing the transformative potential of mindfulness without losing sight of the ambivalences and contradictions involved. The paper thus examines the criticism as well as the potential of mindfulness meditation, hoping to arrive at a critical reconciliation through a hopeful and realistic account of what taking note of the self can do.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Plessis","given":"Erik Mygind","non-dropping-particle":"du"},{"family":"Just","given":"Sine Nørholm"}],"citation-key":"duplessisMindfulnessItNot2021","container-title":"Organization","container-title-short":"Organization","DOI":"10.1177/1350508421995755","ISSN":"1350-5084, 1461-7323","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"135050842199575","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mindfulness—it’s not what you think: Toward critical reconciliation with progressive self-development practices","title-short":"Mindfulness—it’s not what you think","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508421995755"},

  {"id":"ebnerUtilizingWikiSystemsHigher","abstract":"Abstract  Wikis are a website technology for mass collaborative authoring. Today, wikis are increasingly used for educational purposes. Basically, the most important asset of wikis is free and easy access for end users: everybody can contribute, comment and edit—following the principles of Universal access. Consequently, wikis are ideally suited for collaborative learning and a number of studies reported a great success of wikis in terms of active participation, collaboration, and a rapidly growing content. However, the wikis success in education was often linked either to direct incentives or even pressure. This paper strongly argues that this contradicts the original intentions of wikis and, furthermore, weakens the psycho-pedagogical impact. A study is presented which focuses on investigating the success of wikis in higher education, when students are neither enforced to contribute nor directly rewarded similar to the principles of Wikipedia. Amazingly, the results show that, in total, none of the N = 287 students created new articles or edited existing ones during a whole semester. It is concluded that the use of Wiki-Systems in educational settings is much more complicated, and it needs more time to develop a kind of “give-and-take” generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ebner","given":""},{"family":"Kickmeier-Rust","given":""},{"family":"Holzinger","given":""}],"citation-key":"ebnerUtilizingWikiSystemsHigher","container-title":"Universal Access in the Information Society","DOI":"10.1007/s10209-008-0115-2","source":"SpringerLink","title":"Utilizing Wiki-Systems in higher education classes: a chance for universal access?","title-short":"Utilizing Wiki-Systems in higher education classes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10209-008-0115-2"},

Even if your research is excellent, if no one finds your paper, it won’t be cited. Similar to a company for marketing a retail product, Academic Search Engine Optimization (ASEO) of your journal papers is important to market your research findings. ASEO is almost obligatory if you would like to increase readership of your papers, increase citations and acknowledgment and to create an overall stronger academic visibility, both offline and online. By optimizing your articles, you guarantee that your articles are indexed and gain a higher ranking in general and academic search engines, such as Google Scholar. This presentation provides guidelines on how to optimize scholarly literature for academic search engines like Google Scholar, in order to increase the article visibility and citations.

Bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying O2 and CO2 tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit. Systemic gas tensions were unchanged. Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular dP/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular dP/dt and slightly decreased the strain-gauge arch output, while markedly increasing systemic pressure. Coronary blood flow increased; however, coronary vascular resistance wa.as not affected. These studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium. The increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure. Thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood.","author":[{"family":"Ehrhart","given":"I.

Such conferences are rare despite advancements in digitization and despite the many problems surrounding climate change that call into question the sustainability of frequent international air travel.

  {"id":"engholmReflectingContemporaryDesign2017","abstract":"In recent years, design research has been the object of growing attention in universities and academies around the world. The present paper addresses the heterogeneous character of design research and the current need for reflection on the various approaches and interests. For this purpose, the paper follows two steps. First, it proposes a categorisation of the field in the form of a position model. The paper’s underlying assumption is that design research as a discipline exists in many different forms that cannot necessarily be brought together under one common academic research tradition. Therefore, it is necessary to attempt to define the field in order to initiate discussions about what constitutes the various research bases of design.

Considering the report of its death to be an exaggeration but acknowledging that one should never let a good crisis go to waste, I propose a reflection on the challenges faced by the practice of critical thinking in anthropology based on my own research on AIDS in South Africa, trauma among Palestinians, policing and punishment in France, while resituating the questions it raises in a broader history of the discipline. More specifically, I discuss two major strands, genealogical critique and critical theory, suggesting how they may be combined, and two opposed views, critical sociology and the sociology of critique, showing that ethnography can surmount their supposed irreconcilability. Affirming that critique, under its multiple forms, is inherent to the anthropological project, I contend that it is more than ever needed in times laden with worrying spectres.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Fassin","given":"Didier"}],"citation-key":"fassinEnduranceCritique2017","container-title":"Anthropological Theory","container-title-short":"Anthropological Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1463499616688157","ISSN":"1463-4996, 1741-2641","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"4-29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The endurance of critique","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1463499616688157","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"fauldrathLargeScaleSEO2012","abstract":"Aufgrund einen kurzfristigen Ausfalls eines Redners habe ich ad hoc die Möglichkeit bekommen zum Thema Large Scale SEO auf der SMX-München zu sprechen. Mit mir sind Christoph Burseg von der TRG und Jürgen Schlott von Tomorrow Focus Media GmbH mit auf dem Panel.\n\nIch schildere kurz wie wir das Thema SEO organisieren und umsetzen. Dabei gehe ich auf den SEO-Prozess an sich ein aber auch in die Verankerung von SEO in die bestehenden Prozess. Auch die Themen Mitarbeiterschulung und Schnittstellen zu angrenzenden Bereichen sind wichtig. SEO kann nur innerhalb der vorhandenen Strukturen skalieren, weshalb man diese als SEO verstehen und sich an den notwendigen Stellen einbringen muss.\n\nIn der Automatisierung von Arbeitsabläufen liegt ein weiterer Hebel zur Skalierung von SEO. Wir nutzen eine hauseigene Software um regelmäßig unsere optimierten Titel zu prüfen. Nur so können wir sicherstellen, dass keine Titel unbeabsichtigt geändert werden. Auch prüfen wir automatisch jeden neuen Artikel nach Verlinkungsmöglichkeiten zu unseren Zielen. Zuletzt liegen in gut optimierten Schlagwortseiten ein großes Potentials zur Skalierung. Zumindest wenn man die eigenen Inhalte systematisch und kontrolliert inhaltlich erschließt.\n\nLast but not Least stellt ein sinnvolles Reporting ein wichtiges Instrument zur Skalierung dar. Nur durch ein gutes und verständliches Reporting bekommt man dauerhaft eine Organisation mit ins Boot und nur so erhält man die notwendige Unterstützung des Top-Managements. Ohne diese wird SEO nicht nur nicht skalieren sondern komplett scheitern. SEO bedeutet immer seine Onlinestrategie und seine Websites an den Nutzern auszurichten. Eine Website wird sich ändern, wenn SEO und die notwendige Nachfrageorientierung wirklich ernst genommen wird. Und diese Veränderungen bekommt man nur durchgesetzt wenn das Management überzeugt werden kann.\n\nNachfolgend mein kompletter Vortrag:","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fauldrath","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"fauldrathLargeScaleSEO2012","container-title":"Fauldrath.net","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,27]]},"title":"Large Scale SEO–Präsentation auf der SMX München - Fauldrath.net","type":"post-weblog","URL":"http://www.fauldrath.net/large-scale-seo/510"},

  {"id":"fawzyStrategiesMitigationClimate2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to $131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO\n              2\n              emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Fawzy","given":"Samer"},{"family":"Osman","given":"Ahmed I."},{"family":"Doran","given":"John"},{"family":"Rooney","given":"David W."}],"citation-key":"fawzyStrategiesMitigationClimate2020","container-title":"Environmental Chemistry Letters","container-title-short":"Environ Chem Lett","DOI":"10.1007/s10311-020-01059-w","ISSN":"1610-3653, 1610-3661","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"language":"en","page":"2069-2094","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Strategies for mitigation of climate change: a review","title-short":"Strategies for mitigation of climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10311-020-01059-w","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"floridiLogicInformationTheory2019","abstract":"This is a book on the logic of design and hence on how we make, transform, refine, and improve the objects of our knowledge. The starting point is that reality provides the data, to be understood as constraining affordances, and we transform them into information, like semantic engines. Such transformation or repurposing is not equivalent to portraying, or picturing, or photographing, or photocopying anything. It is more like cooking: the dish does not represent the ingredients, it uses them to make something else out of them, yet the reality of the dish and its properties hugely depend on the reality and the properties of the ingredients. Models are not representations understood as pictures, but interpretations understood as data elaborations, of systems. Thus, the whole book may also be read as an articulation and defence of the thesis that knowledge is design, and that philosophy is the ultimate form of conceptual design. This is the third volume in a tetralogy that includes\n              The Philosophy of Information\n              (OUP 2011) and\n              The Ethics of Information\n              (OUP 2013). The three volumes are all written as stand-alone, but they are complementary. By working like a hinge between the two previous books, this third one prepares the basis for volume four, on\n              The Politics of Information\n              . There, the epistemological, conceptual, and normative constructionism supports the study of the design opportunities we have in understanding and shaping what I like to call “the human project” in our information societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Floridi","given":"Luciano"}],"citation-key":"floridiLogicInformationTheory2019","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780198833635.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-883363-5 978-0-19-187206-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,28]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Logic of Information: A Theory of Philosophy as Conceptual Design","title-short":"The Logic of Information","type":"book","URL":"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198833635.001.0001/oso-9780198833635"},

This article sets the scientific stage for understanding and responding to such change for global sustainability and resilient societies. We provide a systemic overview of the current situation where people and nature are dynamically intertwined and embedded in the biosphere, placing shocks and extreme events as part of this dynamic; humanity has become the major force in shaping the future of the Earth system as a whole; and the scale and pace of the human dimension have caused climate change, rapid loss of biodiversity, growing inequalities, and loss of resilience to deal with uncertainty and surprise. Taken together, human actions are challenging the biosphere foundation for a prosperous development of civilizations. The Anthropocene reality—of rising system-wide turbulence—calls for transformative change towards sustainable futures.

Introduction Les observations qui suivent répondent à un double défi posé par l’ouvrage de Pierluigi Basso Fossali, Vers une écologie sémiotique de la culture. Perception, gestion et réappropriation du sens (Limoges, Lambert Lucas, 2017). En premier lieu, il s’agit de fournir au lecteur quelques éléments généraux pouvant s’avérer utiles pour appréhender un ouvrage de grande ampleur et découvrir l’infrastructure de la pensée de l’auteur ; en second lieu, il s’agit en même temps d’interroger certaines de ses propositions théoriques et épistémologiques non seulement par rapport à la sémiotique post-greimassienne mais également par rapport aux chemins actuels et à venir que la sémiotique pourrait emprunter1. Dans une approche transversale, on s’attardera d’abord sur quelques aspects relatifs à son architecture textuelle, qui nous permettront ensuite d’aborder quelques-uns des thèmes ou des grands axes de réflexion. Notre interrogation portera tout particulièrement sur trois dimensions qui soutiennent la démarche épistémologique de Pierluigi Basso Fossali : i) le parti pris de la complexité en sémiotique, aussi bien du point de vue théorique que méthodologique, ii) la mise en valeur qui en découle de la notion d’hétérogénéité, iii) la proposition d’une véritable écologie sémiotique (des cultures), telle qu’elle est explicitement affirmée dès le titre de l’ouvrage.

  {"id":"fontanillePratiqueEthiqueTheorie2008","abstract":"Le concept de « valeur » occupe une place centrale dans les sémiotiques d’inspiration linguistique, issues des travaux de Saussure, Hjelmslev, Benveniste et Greimas, et ce, au nom du principe différentiel qui les fonde. Parmi ces sémiotiques, la tendance massive des vingt dernières années, pour de multiples raisons, a consisté à traiter de ces valeurs dans une perspective esthétique. Sans renier les travaux de cette période féconde, qui a privilégié la voie phénoménologique, la relation au monde sensible, les esthésies et la culture artistique, de nombreux sémioticiens s’intéressent aujourd’hui à des discours, à des objets et à des pratiques qui relèvent de toute évidence d’un autre ordre de valeurs, qui impliquent des normes, une déontologie : en somme, des positions et des valeurs éthiques. L’approche sémiotique de la dimension éthique, dans la perspective ouverte par les recherches sur les pratiques et les interactions sociales, ne peut se cantonner à un inventaire des contenus sémantiques et modaux des valeurs. La forme de ces pratiques et de ces interactions sociales s’exprime essentiellement dans l’ordre syntagmatique, et le traitement sémiotique de l’éthique doit donc être syntagmatique et stratégique. La rhétorique générale de Perelman comporte à cet égard un ensemble de propositions très éclairantes et pourtant faiblement exploitées aujourd’hui : il s’agit, en l’occurrence, de la « théorie du lien », des liaisons et des déliaisons, des ruptures et des freinages qui affectent les relations entre les éléments de la scène argumentative. Cet essai se propose de reprendre ces éléments, d’en formuler une articulation systématique et plus étendue que celle de Perelman, pour en rendre possible l’application aux pratiques sémiotiques en général. L’éthique des pratiques prend alors la forme globale d’une rhétorique des stratégies sociales.\n          , \n            The concept of “value” takes a central place in the semiotics based on linguistic grounds, following the work of Saussure, Hjelmslev, Benveniste and Greimas, and on behalf of the differential principle it is based on. Among these semiotics, the massive trend of the last twenty years, for many reasons, has been to treat these values in an aesthetic way. Without renouncing the work of this fertile period, which has chosen the phenomenological point of view, in relation to the sensitive world, to aesthesy and artistic culture, many semioticians are interested now in speeches, objects and practices that are obviously of a different order of values, which involve standards and ethical rules: in other words, ethical positions and values. The semiotic approach of the ethical dimension, in the context opened by research on the practical and social interactions, cannot be limited to an inventory of semantic and modal contents of values. The ethical organization of these practices and social interactions is expressed mainly on the syntagmatic axis, and the semiotic treatment of ethics must be syntagmatic and strategic. In this respect, the general rhetoric of Perelman contains a set of very enlightening and yet poorly exploited proposals: it is, in this case, the theory of the link, of powerful or weak links, and all operations, positive or negative, that affect the relationships between the components of the practical argumentative scene. This study is intended to resume these elements, to formulate a systematic and larger articulation of Perelman’s theory of links, to make possible its implementation in semiotic practices in general. Ethics of practices then takes the overall shape of a rhetoric of social strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fontanille","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"fontanillePratiqueEthiqueTheorie2008","container-title":"Protée","container-title-short":"pr","DOI":"10.7202/019016ar","ISSN":"1708-2307, 0300-3523","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10,1]]},"language":"fr","page":"11-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pratique et éthique: La théorie du lien","title-short":"Pratique et éthique","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/                 019016ar","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"forlanoDecenteringHumanDesign2016","abstract":"Cities are currently being redesigned with sensors and data at their core. Environmental monitoring, crime tracking and traffic mapping are just a few examples of the socio-technical systems that are remaking cities. These systems are emergent sites of politics, values, and ethics where human and nonhuman actors collaborate, negotiate and debate the futures of their cities. One the one hand, they can be used for prediction, measurement and decision-making, but, on the other hand, they can also be harnessed to imagine alternative possible urban futures. Designers have an important role to play in mediating, making sense of, and intervening in these projects, which are at the intersection of the work of a variety of stakeholders including governments, business and citizens. This article draws on science and technology studies (STS) to think through ways designers can evolve existing human-centered design (HCD) methodologies to contend with socio-technical complexity at a time of great economic and environmental crisis. In particular, this article argues that it is necessary to create and explore methodologies that decenter the human and take the nonhuman seriously in order to meaningfully engage in the design of cities with more responsible, accountable, and ethical ways of engaging with emerging technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Forlano","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"forlanoDecenteringHumanDesign2016","container-title":"Design Issues","container-title-short":"Design Issues","DOI":"10.1162/DESI_a_00398","ISSN":"0747-9360, 1531-4790","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"language":"en","page":"42-54","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Decentering the Human in the Design of Collaborative Cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/DESI_a_00398","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"friedlingstein4CCARBONOUTLOOK2021","abstract":"Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries’ climate progress. For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2020, GATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1 and SLAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.8 GtC yr−1. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021, suggest a rebound in EFOS relative to 2020 of +4.9 % (4.1 % to 5.7 %) globally. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra- tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, 2018a, 2016, 2015b, 2015a, 2014, 2013).

Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries’ climate progress. For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2020, GATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1 and SLAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.8 GtC yr−1. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021, suggest a rebound in EFOS relative to 2020 of +4.9 % (4.1 % to 5.7 %) globally. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra- tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, 2018a, 2016, 2015b, 2015a, 2014, 2013).

  {"id":"fritzHabitusClimateChange2021","abstract":"We explore peoples' dispositions and practices with regard to social–ecological transformations based on a sustainable welfare policy strategy in Sweden. We draw on Bourdieu's concept of habitus to highlight the relations between social positions, dispositions, and position-takings. Using data from an own survey, we identify habitus types and place these in the space of social positions. We apply principal component analysis to a large set of questions about social, ecological, and climate change related topics and identify eight underlying eco–social dispositions. These are used for cluster analyses that find typical constellations of eco–social dispositions within the Swedish population: variants of eco–social habitus. We find seven habitus types and describe their social characteristics, political preferences, and practices. Finally, the seven habitus are plotted onto the map of social positions, the Bourdieusian social space, highlighting their relations—proximities, tensions, and contestations—to each other. We find evidence that political struggles around social–ecological transformations reproduce existing social structures but are also connected to new “eco–social” divisions that appear between groups in similar positions. In the conclusion we discuss the implications for social–ecological transformations based on sustainable welfare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Max"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Håkan"},{"family":"Emilsson","given":"Kajsa"},{"family":"Hildingsson","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Jamil"}],"citation-key":"fritzHabitusClimateChange2021","container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/1468-4446.12887","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"874-890","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Habitus and climate change: Exploring support and resistance to sustainable welfare and social–ecological transformations in Sweden","title-short":"Habitus and climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-4446.12887","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"gallaSocialRelationshipManagement2004","abstract":"Abstract in English\n\nCommunication and collaboration based on the internet are important factors in business, research, and everyday life. The term virtualization denotes the phenomenon that more and more aspects of our lives take place online. In today’s markets, companies have to be quick and flexible in order to be successful. One of the strategies to achieve this is the virtualization of organizations, leading to the abolishment of classical spatial and temporal constraints and to a greater flexibility. The dynamic collaboration of small, modular organizational units is the key idea of this strategy. The partnering problem becomes the pivotal point in such organization networks, raising the question of how to assess the trustworthiness of personally unknown potential partners. Similarly, in online auction houses, customers often do not know whether to trust vendors with respect to the quality of the goods offered. Traditionally, such problems are solved by exploring the personal social network and looking for trusted persons who know the person or organization in question. Yet, due to the increasing variety of communication media, it is difficult to keep aware of all people in one’s personal social network. Therefore it is necessary to support the management of social relationships. The goal of this thesis is the development of a general framework for social relationship management. Starting from observations concerning the aforementioned virtualization tendencies, this work examines internet-based communication and shared information spaces with respect to the kinds of social network data that can be extracted from them. Existing approaches to social relationship management are discussed. Such systems, however, concentrate on only one or very few kinds of social relationships and thus only manage special aspects of a user’s social network. Therefore, a general representation of social relationships is needed which allows for the combination of various kinds of relationships and sources of social network data. On the basis of this analysis and the characterization of social relationships in terms of sociology, this work introduces a formal model of social relationships based on semantic web technologies. The main design goals of this formalization are fostering interoperability, independence from proprietary applications, extensibility, and integration of privacy protection. Building upon the formalization of social relationships, a multiagent system for distributed relationship management is developed. Agents act on behalf of one or several persons and exchange relationship information in order to answer queries initiated by their users or by applications. Three query types can be distinguished: - Exploring the social network up to a certain depth - Checking if a relationship chain with certain characteristics from one person to another exists - Retrieving relationship chains with certain characteristics from one user to another With the help of these three query types both the problem of how to get a trusted estimation of another person’s reputation and the problem of how to keep aware of all people in one’s personal social network can be solved. The concepts developed in this work have been prototypically implemented and represent a comprehensive solution of the aforementioned problems of social relationship management in internetbased communication and shared information spaces.\n\nAbstract in Deutsch\n\nKommunikation und Kollaboration auf Basis des Internets sind heute wichtige Faktoren in Wirtschaft, Forschung und Privatleben. Der Begriff \"Virtualisierung\" greift das Phänomen auf, dass mehr und mehr Teile unseres Alltags \"online\" stattfinden. In heutigen Märkten müssen Unternehmen schnell und flexibel sein, um Erfolg zu haben. Eine der Strategien hierzu ist die Abwendung von klassischen räumlichen und zeitlichen Einschränkungen in Richtung der Virtualisierung von Organisationen und damit in Richtung einer erhöhten Flexibilität. Die dynamische, auftragsbezogene Zusammenarbeit kleiner und modularer organisatorischer Einheiten ist die Schlüsselidee dieser Strategie. Die Partnerfindung wird hierbei zur zentralen Problemstellung und führt zu der Frage, wie die Vertrauenswürdigkeit unbekannter möglicher Partner effektiv und effizient eingeschätzt werden kann. Ähnliche Fragestellungen treten in Online-Auktionshäusern auf, wo Käufer häufig die Vertrauenswürdigkeit der Verkäufer nur schwierig einschätzen können. Traditionell werden solche Probleme mit Hilfe des eigenen sozialen Beziehungsnetzwerks gelöst, indem Personen befragt werden, die bereits Erfahrungen mit dem fraglichen Verkäufer sammeln konnten. Aufgrund der Vielzahl der verwendeten Kommunikationsmedien ist es jedoch zunehmend schwierig, einen Überblick über das eigene soziale Netzwerk zu behalten. Eine Unterstützung hierfür ist notwendig. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Entwicklung eines allgemeinen Frameworks für soziales Beziehungsmanagement. Ausgehend von den zuvor erwähnten Visualisierungstendenzen untersucht die Arbeit internetbasierte Kommunikation und gemeinsame Informationsräume in Bezug auf Informationen über soziale Beziehungsnetzwerke. Existierende Ansätze hierzu werden untersucht. Existierende Systeme konzentrieren sich jedoch stets auf einen kleinen Ausschnitt der möglichen Aspekte sozialer Beziehungen und liefern daher nur unvollständige Informationen. Daher wird ein allgemeiner Ansatz benötigt, der die Integration von Beziehungsinformationen verschiedenster Arten und aus verschiedensten Quellen erlaubt. Ausgehend von der Analyse sozialer Beziehungen und ihrer Charakterisierung anhand von Begriffen aus dem Fachbereich der Soziologie führt die Arbeit ein formales Modell für soziale Beziehungen ein, das auf Methoden des Semantic Web aufbaut. Die Hauptziele dieser Formalisierung sind Interoperabilität, Unabhängigkeit von speziellen Anwendungen, Erweiterung sowie die Berücksichtigung von Privatheit. Aufbauend auf die Formalisierung von sozialen Beziehungen stellt die Arbeit ein Multiagentensystem für Beziehungsmanagement vor. Agenten agieren im Auftrag von Benutzern und verwalten Beziehungsinformationen oder tauschen Informationen untereinander aus, um Anfragen ihrer Benutzer zu beantworten. Drei wesentliche Arten von Anfragen können hier unterschieden werden: - Erkunden des sozialen Netzwerks bis zu einer bestimmten Tiefe - Prüfen, ob es eine Beziehungskette mit bestimmten Eigenschaften von einer Person zu einer anderen Person gibt - Ermitteln aller solcher Beziehungsketten. Auf Basis dieser drei Anfragearten ist es möglich, die beiden eingangs genannten Probleme zu lösen, namentlich die Einschätzung der Vertrauenswürdigkeit unbekannter Personen sowie die Verbesserung des Überblicks über das eigene soziale Netzwerk. Die Ansätze dieser Arbeit wurden prototypisch implementiert und stellen eine umfassende Lösung für die genannten Probleme bei sozialem Beziehungsmanagement bei internetbasierter Kommunikation und gemeinsamen Informationsräumen dar.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Galla","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"gallaSocialRelationshipManagement2004","genre":"Text.PhDThesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,1,21]]},"language":"en","note":"#Abstract-ENG","publisher":"Technische Universität München","title":"Social Relationship Management in Internet-based Communication and Shared Information Spaces","type":"thesis","URL":"http://tumb1.biblio.tu-muenchen.de/publ/diss/in/2004/galla.html"},

  {"id":"gardnerPublicationsPublicActions2021","abstract":"Thousands of universities have made climate emergency declarations; however the higher education sector is not rising to the collective challenge with the urgency commensurate with scientific warnings. Universities are promoting an increased focus on sustainability through their research, teaching and their own institutional footprints. However, we suggest that such initiatives will be insufficient to catalyse the required transformations in our societies and economies because of (i) the time lags inherent in education and research pathways to impact, and (ii) their failure to address either real-world political processes or the forces invested in maintaining the status quo. We therefore suggest that academics should move from publications to public actions and engage in advocacy and activism to affect urgent and transformational change. We discuss the barriers to engagement in advocacy that academics face, and propose a number of actions that universities should adopt to help overcome them. These include explicitly recognising advocacy as part of the work mandate of academic staff by altering work allocation models, facilitating engaged research sabbaticals, altering hiring and promotion policies, and providing training to enhance the effectiveness of engagement. In addition, universities must defend the right of academics to engage in protest and push back against emerging threats to academic freedom. Such actions would strengthen a rich tradition of academic protest and enhance the contribution of universities to the public good in areas well beyond sustainability, for example race and social justice (Black Lives Matter, decolonising education) and public health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Charlie J."},{"family":"Thierry","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Rowlandson","given":"William"},{"family":"Steinberger","given":"Julia K."}],"citation-key":"gardnerPublicationsPublicActions2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Sustainability","container-title-short":"Front.

The concept was discussed and tested with relevant actors and will be used for the actual evaluation of the strategy in 2017 and 2018. The final concept was approved by the interministerial working group on adaptation. The concept will be used to continuously review the evaluation process in Germany. The first evaluation report will be presented in 2019. In the long term, the evaluation concept shall be used to check whether the activities and instruments of the adaptation process are suitable to achieve the main goal of the DAS: “to reduce vulnerability and improve the adaptive capacity of ecologic, social and economic systems towards the unavoidable impacts of climate change.” In a first step, the evaluation shall be used to gain insights for the advancement and improvement of the adaptation process in Germany. The concept is based on a logic model designed for the evaluation from which five central evaluation questions were derived. A multi-method approach is used to collect required data and information. Instruments that will be used for data collection are, amongst others, a document analysis, several interview series and the analysis of indicators. Data will be analysed along defined criteria which ensures that the evaluation results are comprehensible and transparent. In order to validate results, a Delphisurvey will be conducted with central actors that are involved in the adaptation policy process. This report presents the evaluation concept, a description of the survey instruments that shall be used and a detailed description on how the concept was developed.","author":[{"family":"Gaus","given":"Hansjörg"}],"citation-key":"gausChristianKindTheresa","language":"de","page":"38","source":"Zotero","title":"Christian Kind, Theresa Kaiser adelphi, Berlin","type":"article-journal"},

I juxtapose the modes of reference [REF] and fiction [FIC] with a famous digression reflecting on historiographical practice in William of Malmesbury’s Gesta regum Anglorum. AIME offers analytical rigor to medievalists’ discussions of the notorious overlap between “history” and “fiction.” William’s bold use of [FIC] to advance [REF] is in the spirit of AIME’s project, though he goes further in trusting [FIC] than AIME is always willing to do. An instance of medieval historiography thus leads the way in overcoming a residual Modern suspicion of a nonreferential mode of existence and of knowledge. Additionally, although AIME’s restriction of crossings to two modes is useful for defining each, in practice more than two are often found “plaited.” I make this argument through a discussion of the use of brackets to mark verse form and rhyme scheme in medieval manuscripts: an example of [TEC•FIC•REF] plaiting. Finally, I call for further development of the multimodal possibilities of “form,” which AIME flags but does not pursue, and for a new mode of existence to be added to Latour’s list: [FOR].","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"gilbertFormModeExistence2020","container-title":"Romanic Review","DOI":"10.1215/00358118-8007950","ISSN":"0035-8118, 2688-5220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"27-47","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Form and/as Mode of Existence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/romanic-review/article/111/1/27/164264/Form-andas-Mode-of-Existence","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"goldbergDiscussingGlobalWarming2019","abstract":"Climate change is an urgent global issue, with demands for personal, collective, and governmental action. Although a large body of research has investigated the influence of communication on public engagement with climate change, few studies have investigated the role of interpersonal discussion. Here we use panel data with 2 time points to investigate the role of climate conversations in shaping beliefs and feelings about global warming. We find evidence of reciprocal causality. That is, discussing global warming with friends and family leads people to learn influential facts, such as the scientific consensus that human-caused global warming is happening. In turn, stronger perceptions of scientific agreement increase beliefs that climate change is happening and human-caused, as well as worry about climate change. When assessing the reverse causal direction, we find that knowing the scientific consensus further leads to increases in global warming discussion. These findings suggest that climate conversations with friends and family enter people into a proclimate social feedback loop.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Matthew H."},{"family":"Linden","given":"Sander","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Maibach","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Leiserowitz","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"goldbergDiscussingGlobalWarming2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1906589116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,23]]},"language":"en","page":"14804-14805","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Discussing global warming leads to greater acceptance of climate science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1906589116","volume":"116"},

I use this metaphor to scrutinize the transmission, in manuscript Chantilly, Musée Condé 653, of Antoine de la Sale’s Le Paradis de la Reine Sibylle, a fifteenth-century account of travel to, and myths associated with, the Monte della Sibilla in the Apennine Mountains of Italy. From a Latourian perspective, Chantilly 653 attests to the agency of a mountainous landscape and the myths that inhabit it, as well as to the ways in which myths solicit representation in material form. In this instance, material form is a medieval manuscript, one that can be read, through a Latourian lens, as a set of category crossings that bring together points in space and time. Those points are not organized as historical periods but rather as modes of understanding the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Griffin","given":"Miranda"}],"citation-key":"griffinTrailSibylMountain2020","container-title":"Romanic Review","DOI":"10.1215/00358118-8007943","ISSN":"0035-8118, 2688-5220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"8-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the Trail of the Sibyl’s Mountain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/romanic-review/article/111/1/8/164267/On-the-Trail-of-the-Sibyls-MountainAntoine-de-la","volume":"111"},

Here we provide a contrasting perspective by developing a narrative of future change based on observable trends that results in low energy demand. We describe and quantify changes in activity levels and energy intensity in the Global North and South for all major energy services. We project that global final energy demand by 2050 reduces to 245 EJ, around 40% lower than today despite rising population, income and activity. Using an integrated assessment modelling framework, we show how changes in the quantity and type of energy services drive structural change in intermediate and upstream supply sectors (energy and land use). Down-sizing the global energy system dramatically improves the feasibility of low-carbon supply-side transformation. Our scenario meets the 1.5°C climate target as well as many Sustainable Development Goals, without relying on negative emission technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Grubler","given":"Arnulf"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Bento","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Boza-Kiss","given":"Benigna"},{"family":"Krey","given":"Volker"},{"family":"McCollum","given":"David L."},{"family":"Rao","given":"Narasimha D."},{"family":"Riahi","given":"Keywan"},{"family":"Rogelj","given":"Joeri"},{"family":"De Stercke","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Cullen","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Frank","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Fricko","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Gidden","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Havlík","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Huppmann","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kiesewetter","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Rafaj","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Schoepp","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Valin","given":"Hugo"}],"citation-key":"grublerLowEnergyDemand2018a","container-title":"Nature Energy","container-title-short":"Nat Energy","DOI":"10.1038/s41560-018-0172-6","ISSN":"2058-7546","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"language":"en","page":"515-527","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A low energy demand scenario for meeting the 1.5 °C target and sustainable development goals without negative emission technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-018-0172-6","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"haberlSystematicReviewEvidence2020","abstract":"Strategies toward ambitious climate targets usually rely on the concept of ‘decoupling’; that is, they aim at promoting economic growth while reducing the use of natural resources and GHG emissions. GDP growth coinciding with absolute reductions in emissions or resource use is denoted as ‘absolute decoupling’, as opposed to ‘relative decoupling’, where resource use or emissions increase less so than does GDP. Based on the bibliometric mapping in part I (Wiedenhofer et al, 2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 063002), we synthesize the evidence emerging from the selected 835 peer-reviewed articles. We evaluate empirical studies of decoupling related to final/useful energy, exergy, use of material resources, as well as CO2 and total GHG emissions. We find that relative decoupling is frequent for material use as well as GHG and CO2 emissions but not for useful exergy, a quality-based measure of energy use. Primary energy can be decoupled from GDP largely to the extent to which the conversion of primary energy to useful exergy is improved. Examples of absolute long-term decoupling are rare, but recently some industrialized countries have decoupled GDP from both production- and, weaklier, consumption-based CO2 emissions. We analyze policies or strategies in the decoupling literature by classifying them into three groups: (1) Green growth, if sufficient reductions of resource use or emissions were deemed possible without altering the growth trajectory. (2) Degrowth, if reductions of resource use or emissions were given priority over GDP growth. (3) Others, e.g. if the role of energy for GDP growth was analyzed without reference to climate change mitigation. We conclude that large rapid absolute reductions of resource use and GHG emissions cannot be achieved through observed decoupling rates, hence decoupling needs to be complemented by sufficiency-oriented strategies and strict enforcement of absolute reduction targets. More research is needed on interdependencies between wellbeing, resources and emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Haberl","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Wiedenhofer","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Virág","given":"Doris"},{"family":"Kalt","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Plank","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Brockway","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Fishman","given":"Tomer"},{"family":"Hausknost","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Krausmann","given":"Fridolin"},{"family":"Leon-Gruchalski","given":"Bartholomäus"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Pichler","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Schaffartzik","given":"Anke"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Tânia"},{"family":"Streeck","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Creutzig","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"haberlSystematicReviewEvidence2020","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

It takes into account a subset of the possible health impacts, and assumes continued economic growth and health progress. The assessment takes into account a subset of the possible health impacts, and assumes continued economic growth and health progress. Even under these conditions, it concludes that climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050; 38 000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48 000 due to diarrhoea, 60 000 due to malaria, and 95 000 due to childhood undernutrition. Results indicate that the burden of disease from climate change in the future will continue to fall mainly on children in developing countries, but that other population groups will be increasingly affected. \"Climate change is expected to affect many aspects of health. This report presents an assessment of the expected results on a subset of these health outcomes, for which quantitative evidence is available at the global level: heat-related mortality, coastal flood mortality, diarrhoea, malaria, dengue and undernutrition. Although the assessment does not include all potential health risks, it makes clear that climate change is likely to have significant impacts in coming decades, and indicates the scale and nature of the challenges that need to be addressed through strengthening health resilience to climate risks, and mitigating climate change.\"--Page 4 of cover.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hales","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Kovats","given":"Sari"},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Campbell-Lendrum","given":"Diarmid"},{"literal":"World Health Organization"},{"literal":"World Health Organization"},{"literal":"Health Security and Environment Cluster"}],"citation-key":"halesQuantitativeRiskAssessment2014","ISBN":"978-92-4-150769-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 897764432","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Quantitative risk assessment of the effects of climate change on selected causes of death, 2030s and 2050s","type":"book","URL":"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134014/1/9789241507691_eng.pdf"},

  {"id":"hansenYoungPeopleBurden2017","abstract":"Abstract. Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial Holocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1 °C relative to the 1880–1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3 °C. We show that global temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior (Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6–9 m higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require negative emissions, i.e., extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices, including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be minimized. In contrast, continued high fossil fuel emissions today place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction if they are to limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or air capture of CO2 have minimal estimated costs of USD 89–535 trillion this century and also have large risks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high fossil fuel emissions unarguably sentences young people to either a massive, implausible cleanup or growing deleterious climate impacts or both.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"James"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Makiko"},{"family":"Kharecha","given":"Pushker"},{"family":"Schuckmann","given":"Karina","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Beerling","given":"David J."},{"family":"Cao","given":"Junji"},{"family":"Marcott","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Masson-Delmotte","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Prather","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Rohling","given":"Eelco J."},{"family":"Shakun","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Pete"},{"family":"Lacis","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Ruedy","given":"Reto"}],"citation-key":"hansenYoungPeopleBurden2017","container-title":"Earth System Dynamics","container-title-short":"Earth Syst.

Using long-term observations, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the 2018–2019 (consecutive) summer drought is unprecedented in the last 250 years, and its combined impact on the growing season vegetation activities is stronger compared to the 2003 European drought. Using a suite of climate model simulation outputs, we underpin the role of anthropogenic warming on exacerbating the future risk of such a consecutive drought event. Under the highest Representative Concentration Pathway, (RCP 8.5), we notice a seven-fold increase in the occurrence of the consecutive droughts, with additional 40 ($$\\pm \\, 5$$) million ha of cultivated areas being affected by such droughts, during the second half of the twenty-first century. The occurrence is significantly reduced under low and medium scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5), suggesting that an effective mitigation strategy could aid in reducing the risk of future consecutive droughts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hari","given":"Vittal"},{"family":"Rakovec","given":"Oldrich"},{"family":"Markonis","given":"Yannis"},{"family":"Hanel","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Rohini"}],"citation-key":"hariIncreasedFutureOccurrences2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-68872-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Increased future occurrences of the exceptional 2018–2019 Central European drought under global warming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68872-9","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"henshawGrowthConstantFingerprints","abstract":"Recently discovered long term growth constants in the rise of atmospheric CO2 are signs of global economic selforganizational states underlying driving the acceleration of global warming. Closely fitting with familiar events of world economic history, they tie climate change, step by step, with how we have strived to become who we now are. We found the growth of atmospheric CO2 began in about 1780, coincident with the perfection of the steam engine, and grew for 160 years at a constant rate of 1.48 %/yr, only interrupted by WWII. The organization of the modern world economy then pushed up the growth constant of CO2 PPM to 2.0 %/yr. These growth constants are fingerprints of stable world self-organized states driven to maximize rates of economic growth. The current constant growth state, being unchallenged, is then projected to reach the 1.5 C threshold by 2031, nine years earlier than the IPCC’s 2018 prediction of 2040. A brief discussion follows from a natural systems view of what could guide big self-organized growth systems account for their externalities and prepare for long life rather than environmental failure.","author":[{"family":"Henshaw","given":"Jessie"}],"citation-key":"henshawGrowthConstantFingerprints","language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Growth Constant Fingerprints of Economically Driven Climate Change:","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"herringtonUpdateLimitsGrowth2021","abstract":"In the 1972 bestseller Limits to Growth (LtG), the authors concluded that, if global society kept pursuing economic growth, it would experience a decline in food production, industrial output, and ultimately population, within this century. The LtG authors used a system dynamics model to study interactions between global variables, varying model assumptions to generate different scenarios. Previous empirical-data comparisons since then by Turner showed closest alignment with a scenario that ended in collapse. This research constitutes a data update to LtG, by examining to what extent empirical data aligned with four LtG scenarios spanning a range of technological, resource, and societal assumptions. The research benefited from improved data availability since the previous updates and included a scenario and two variables that had not been part of previous comparisons. The two scenarios aligning most closely with observed data indicate a halt in welfare, food, and industrial production over the next decade or so, which puts into question the suitability of continuous economic growth as humanity’s goal in the twenty-first century. Both scenarios also indicate subsequent declines in these variables, but only one—where declines are caused by pollution—depicts a collapse. The scenario that aligned most closely in earlier comparisons was not amongst the two closest aligning scenarios in this research. The scenario with the smallest declines aligned least with empirical data; however, absolute differences were often not yet large. The four scenarios diverge significantly more after 2020, suggesting that the window to align with this last scenario is closing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Herrington","given":"Gaya"}],"citation-key":"herringtonUpdateLimitsGrowth2021","container-title":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/jiec.13084","ISSN":"1088-1980, 1530-9290","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6]]},"language":"en","page":"614-626","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Update to limits to growth: Comparing the World3 model with empirical data","title-short":"Update to limits to growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13084","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"hickelGreenGrowthPossible2019","abstract":"The notion of green growth has emerged as a dominant policy response to climate change and ecological breakdown. Green growth theory asserts that continued economic expansion is compatible with our planet’s ecology, as technological change and substitution will allow us to absolutely decouple GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions. This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we ﬁnd that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5°C or 2°C, even under optimistic policy conditions. We conclude that green growth is likely to be a misguided objective, and that policymakers need to look toward alternative strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hickel","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Kallis","given":"Giorgos"}],"citation-key":"hickelGreenGrowthPossible2019","container-title":"New Political Economy","container-title-short":"New Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964","ISSN":"1356-3467, 1469-9923","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Is Green Growth Possible?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964"},

According to our primary method, which relies on exchange-rate diﬀerentials, we ﬁnd that in the most recent year of data the global North (‘advanced economies’) appropriated from the South commodities worth $2.2 trillion in Northern prices — enough to end extreme poverty 15 times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled $62 trillion (constant 2011 dollars), or $152 trillion when accounting for lost growth. Appropriation through unequal exchange represents up to 7% of Northern GDP and 9% of Southern GDP. We also test several alternative methods, for comparison: we quantify unequal exchange in terms of wage diﬀerentials instead of exchange-rate diﬀerentials, and report drain in global average prices as well as Northern prices. Regardless of the method, we ﬁnd that the intensity of exploitation and the scale of unequal exchange increased signiﬁcantly during the structural adjustment period of the 1980s and 1990s. This study aﬃrms that drain from the South remains a signiﬁcant feature of the world economy in the post-colonial era; rich countries continue to rely on imperial forms of appropriation to sustain their high levels of income and consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hickel","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Zoomkawala","given":"Huzaifa"}],"citation-key":"hickelPlunderPostColonialEra2021","container-title":"New Political Economy","container-title-short":"New Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153","ISSN":"1356-3467, 1469-9923","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1030-1047","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Plunder in the Post-Colonial Era: Quantifying Drain from the Global South Through Unequal Exchange, 1960–2018","title-short":"Plunder in the Post-Colonial Era","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"hickelQuantifyingNationalResponsibility2020","abstract":"<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>This analysis proposes a novel method for quantifying national responsibility for damages related to climate change by looking at national contributions to cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in excess of the planetary boundary of 350 ppm atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This approach is rooted in the principle of equal per capita access to atmospheric commons.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>For this analysis, national fair shares of a safe global carbon budget consistent with the planetary boundary of 350 ppm were derived. These fair shares were then subtracted from countries' actual historical emissions (territorial emissions from 1850 to 1969, and consumption-based emissions from 1970 to 2015) to determine the extent to which each country has overshot or undershot its fair share. Through this approach, each country's share of responsibility for global emissions in excess of the planetary boundary was calculated.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>As of 2015, the USA was responsible for 40% of excess global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The European Union (EU-28) was responsible for 29%. The G8 nations (the USA, EU-28, Russia, Japan, and Canada) were together responsible for 85%. Countries classified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as Annex I nations (ie, most industrialised countries) were responsible for 90% of excess emissions. The Global North was responsible for 92%. By contrast, most countries in the Global South were within their boundary fair shares, including India and China (although China will overshoot soon).</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>These figures indicate that high-income countries have a greater degree of responsibility for climate damages than previous methods have implied. These results offer a just framework for attributing national responsibility for excess emissions, and a guide for determining national liability for damages related to climate change, consistent with the principles of planetary boundaries and equal access to atmospheric commons.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>None.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hickel","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"hickelQuantifyingNationalResponsibility2020","container-title":"The Lancet Planetary Health","container-title-short":"The Lancet Planetary Health","DOI":"10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30196-0","ISSN":"2542-5196","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"language":"English","page":"e399-e404","PMID":"32918885","source":"www.thelancet.com","title":"Quantifying national responsibility for climate breakdown: an equality-based attribution approach for carbon dioxide emissions in excess of the planetary boundary","title-short":"Quantifying national responsibility for climate breakdown","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30196-0/abstract","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"hickelSustainableDevelopmentIndex2020","abstract":"When the Human Development Index (HDI) was introduced in the 1990s, it was an important step toward a more sensible measure of progress, one defined less by GDP growth and more by social goals. But the limitations of HDI have become clear in the 21st century, given a growing crisis of climate change and ecological breakdown. HDI pays no attention to ecology, and retains an emphasis on high levels of income that – given strong correlations between income and ecological impact – violates sustainability principles. The countries that score highest on the HDI also contribute most, in per capita terms, to climate change and other forms of ecological breakdown. In this sense, HDI promotes a model of development that is empirically incompatible with ecological stability, and impossible to universalize. In this paper I propose an alternative index that corrects for these problems: the Sustainable Development Index (SDI). The SDI retains the base formula of the HDI but places a sufficiency threshold on per capita income, and divides by two key indicators of ecological impact: CO2 emissions and material footprint, both calculated in per capita consumption-based terms and rendered vis-à-vis planetary boundaries. The SDI is an indicator of strong sustainability that measures nations’ ecological efficiency in delivering human development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hickel","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"hickelSustainableDevelopmentIndex2020","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.05.011","ISSN":"09218009","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","page":"106331","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The sustainable development index: Measuring the ecological efficiency of human development in the anthropocene","title-short":"The sustainable development index","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800919303386","volume":"167"},

  {"id":"hobsonSmallStoriesClosing2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            There is now no doubt that current global production-consumption-disposal systems are threatening the fundamental conditions of existence on this planet. In response, the pressing need for total system transformation has gained civic and political traction, feeding into long-standing debates and interventions that are aimed at recalibrating prevailing economic and social practices. One such debate and intervention is that of the circular economy (CE). Here, advocates argue that current linear resource and energy use systems must be reconfigured into loops of re-use, repair, refurbishment, and recycling, displacing primary production and lessening greenhouse gas emissions in the process. This agenda has potentially profound implications for aspects of daily social practices. Yet, to date, little attention has been paid (politically and in research) to how the CE does and will interact with everyday habits, norms, and meanings. In response, this paper explores some of the conceptual assumptions underlying the CE ‘consumer’. It argues that mainstream CE debates are underscored by an impoverished view of our relationships with complex material cultures, which in turn is creating barriers to transformation. Drawing on empirical research into responses to the CE in the UK and the Netherlands, this paper contrasts the challenges of inciting consumers to take up new, resource-efficient business models in contexts of hyper-consumerism, with a more hopeful ‘small story’ of overt, small-scale circular spaces, that nevertheless embed the CE and its underlying impetuses more clearly into the everyday.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hobson","given":"Kersty"}],"citation-key":"hobsonSmallStoriesClosing2020","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-019-02480-z","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"language":"en","page":"99-116","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Small stories of closing loops’: social circularity and the everyday circular economy","title-short":"‘Small stories of closing loops’","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-019-02480-z","volume":"163"},

  {"id":"HowGoogleQuietly","abstract":"A recent scientific paper proposed that, like Big Tobacco in the Seventies, Big Tech thrives on creating uncertainty around the impacts of its products and business model. One of the ways it does this is by cultivating pockets of friendly academics who can be relied on to echo Big Tech talking points, giving them added gravitas in the eyes of lawmakers. Google highlighted working with favourable academics as a key aim in its strategy, leaked in October 2020, for lobbying the EU’s Digital Markets Act – sweeping legislation that could seriously undermine tech giants’ market dominance if it goes through.  Now, a New Statesman investigation can reveal that over the last five years, six leading academic institutes in the EU have taken tens of millions of pounds of funding from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to research issues linked to the tech firms' business models, from privacy and data protection to AI ethics and competition in digital markets. While this funding tends to come with guarantees of academic independence, this creates an ethical quandary where the subject of research is also often the primary funder of it.   var pymParent = new pym.Parent(\"bars\", \"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/live/nsmg-072/bars/index.html\", {}); The New Statesman has also found evidence of an inconsistent approach to transparency, with some senior academics failing to disclose their industry funding. Other academics have warned that the growing dependence on funding from the industry raises questions about how tech firms influence the debate around the ethics of the markets they have created. The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), for example, received a $7.5m grant from Facebook in 2019 to fund five years of research, while the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society in Berlin, has accepted almost €14m from Google since it was founded in 2012, and the tech giant accounts for a third of the institute's third-party funding.  The Humboldt Institute is seeking to diversify its funding sources, but still receives millions from Google  Annual funding to the Humboldt Institute by Google and other third-party institutions !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,8]]},"citation-key":"HowGoogleQuietly","language":"en","title":"How Google quietly funds Europe’s leading tech policy institutes","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.newstatesman.com/business/sectors/2021/07/how-google-quietly-funds-europe-s-leading-tech-policy-institutes"},

  {"id":"ismaelQuantumMechanics2021","abstract":"Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, amathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopicparticles — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use toexplore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularlysuccessful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders aboveany theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is wellunderstood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, andwhy, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered bydescribing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thingperforms the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at oneend is converted into what comes out the other. The question of whatkind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is verylittle agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about whatthe world is like according to quantum mechanics. Minimallyinterpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way themicroscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects ourmeasuring instruments, described in everyday language or the languageof classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what amicroscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribedmanner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how thoseapparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of thesort the theory describes.[1], That is what an interpretation of the theory would provide: a properaccount of what the world is like according to quantum mechanics,intrinsically and from the bottom up. The problems with giving aninterpretation (not just a comforting, homey sort of interpretation,i.e., not just an interpretation according to which the world isn’t toodifferent from the familiar world of common sense, but anyinterpretation at all) are dealt with in other sections of thisencyclopedia. Here, we are concerned only with the mathematical heartof the theory, the theory in its capacity as a mathematical machine,and — whatever is true of the rest of it — this part of thetheory makes exquisitely good sense.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ismael","given":"Jenann"}],"citation-key":"ismaelQuantumMechanics2021","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Fall 2021","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Quantum Mechanics","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/qm/"},

  {"id":"jacksonAllModelsAre","abstract":"This paper summarises the dilemma associated with using mainstream, macroeconomic models to guide disruptive, transformative change such as those that might occur under ‘deep decarbonisation’: a rapid transition to a net-zero carbon economy. On the one hand, some form of macro-economic modelling framework is essential to enable policy-makers to exercise shortand long-term fiscal responsibility. On the other hand, incremental models based on historical behaviour are a poor guide to outcomes under circumstances of disruptive change. The paper briefly reviews the current UK government modelling framework and highlights its relative advantages and shortcomings. It then proposes a pragmatic approach to the challenge based on ‘living with’ the existing framework for now, whilst providing an early signal to establish a ‘new Treasury model’ based on commissioning an immediate in-depth review of the challenge. Such a review could usefully address a range of issues, including: the appropriate remit of a new Treasury model; the institutional architecture of (and responsibilities for) macroeconomic modelling across government; and a set of proposed responses to the challenges associated with modelling disruptive change. Finally, the paper points briefly to a deeper issue on which a transformational economics will depend: the limitations of GDP itself as a measure of economic welfare.","author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"jacksonAllModelsAre","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"\"All Models Are Wrong\" THE CHALLENGE OF MODELLING ‘DEEP DECARBONISATION’","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"jacksonZeroCarbonSooner2019","abstract":"This briefing paper addresses the question of when the UK should aim for zero (or net zero) carbon emissions. Starting from the global carbon budget which would allow the world an estimated 66% chance of limiting climate warming to 1.5o C, the paper derives a carbon budget for the UK of 2.5 GtCO2. The briefing then analyses a variety of emission pathways and target dates in terms of their adequacy for remaining within this budget. A key finding is that a target date for zero carbon is not sufficient to determine whether the UK remains within its carbon budget. Policy must specify both a target date and an emissions pathway. For a linear reduction pathway not to exceed the carbon budget the target year would have to be 2025. Nonlinear pathways, such as those with constant percentage reduction rates, have a higher chance of remaining within the available budget provided that the reduction starts early enough and the reduction rate is high enough. It is notable that reduction rates high enough both to lead to zero carbon (on a consumption basis) by 2050 and to remain within the carbon budget require absolute reductions of more than 95% of carbon emissions as early as 2030. On this basis, the paper argues in favour of setting a UK target for net zero carbon emissions by 2030 or earlier, with a maximum of 5% emissions addressed through negative emission technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"jacksonZeroCarbonSooner2019","event-place":"Guildford","genre":"CUSP Working Paper No 18.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7]]},"language":"en","page":"12","publisher":"University of Surrey","publisher-place":"Guildford","source":"Zotero","title":"Zero Carbon Sooner—The case for an early zero carbon target for the UK","title-short":"Zero Carbon Sooner","type":"report","URL":"https://www.cusp.ac.uk/themes/aetw/zero-carbon-sooner/"},

  {"id":"johnsonTragedyCognitionPsychological2009","abstract":"In an ideal world, people would tackle major crises such as global climate change as rational actors, weighing the costs, benefits and probabilities of success of alternative policies accurately and impartially. Unfortunately, human brains are far from accurate and impartial. Mounting research in experimental psychology reveals that we are all subject to systematic biases in judgement and decision-making. While such biases may have been adaptive heuristics that promoted survival and reproduction in the Pleistocene environment of our evolutionary past, in today's world of technological sophistication, industrial power and mass societies, psychological biases can lead to disasters on an unprecedented scale. Beyond the exploding ecological and socio-economic research on climate change and how to deal with the 'tragedy of the commons', it is a better understanding of human psychology – 'the tragedy of cognition' – that may ultimately tip the balance against the seeds of our own destruction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Levin","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"johnsonTragedyCognitionPsychological2009","container-title":"Current Science","ISSN":"0011-3891","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"1593-1603","publisher":"Current Science Association","source":"JSTOR","title":"The tragedy of cognition: psychological biases and environmental inaction","title-short":"The tragedy of cognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24107300","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"jorgensenPlanetTalksClimate","abstract":"In the 10th episode of Planet A’s second season, Dan Jørgensen talks with Jason Bordoff, the Director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy and the Dean of the University’s Climate School.\n\nThey touch upon the lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis and the temporary decline in global energy consumption, the Biden administration and climate politics in the US.\n\nAnd they discuss the geopolitics of climate change, where Bordoff argues there is a difference between the influence that “electro states” such as China will have in the future and “petro states” such as Saudi Arabia have had in the past, which means that the transition to a zero-carbon world will shift power in very unexpected ways.\n\nLast year Bordoff wrote a comment in Foreign Policy magazine on this very subject:\n\n“Everything You Think About the Geopolitics of Climate Change Is Wrong - The transition to a zero-carbon world will shift power in very unexpected ways”.\n\nOver the last eight years, Bordoff has made the Center on Global Energy Policy one of the world’s leading institutions on energy and climate issues.\n\nThe Center has not only attracted scores of high-profile speakers, but also covers a wide range of issues from carbon taxation to technology development and the role of geopolitics.\n\nBefore joining academia, Bordoff served as Special Assistant to President Barack Obama. And, prior to that, he held several other senior positions at the White House. He has also worked in President Bill Clinton’s Administration, the consultancy\n\nMcKinsey & Company and the renowned think tank, the Brookings Institution. Moreover, Bordoff is a regular columnist for Foreign Policy magazine and a frequent commentator for the BBC. Furthermore, he has been writing on energy and climate politics for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"citation-key":"jorgensenPlanetTalksClimate","collection-title":"Show Planet A - Talks on climate change","dimensions":"42' 08''","director":[{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Dan"}],"language":"en-GB","title":"‎Planet A - Talks on climate change: Jason Bordoff - on the geopolitics of climate change on Apple Podcasts e - 3 Jul 2021","title-short":"‎Planet A - Talks on climate change","type":"broadcast","URL":"https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/jason-bordoff-on-the-geopolitics-of-climate-change/id1521997920?i=1000527717843"},

It examines how the two authors reflect on the pluralities of language and community that connect them to readerships both at home and in exile, focusing especially on Brunetto’s Rettorica and Dante’s Convivio. The essay investigates Brunetto’s rhetorical doctrine and Dante’s models of vernacular knowledge sharing by drawing on AIME’s notion of the diplomat, whose measured speech helps “renegotiate the new frontiers of self and other.” It is especially concerned with the modes of engagement Latour labels as the beings of politics [POL], law [LAW], and fiction [FIC].","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Keen","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"keenExtracomunitario2020","container-title":"Romanic Review","DOI":"10.1215/00358118-8007957","ISSN":"0035-8118, 2688-5220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"48-65","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Extracomunitario?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/romanic-review/article/111/1/48/164258/ExtracomunitarioNetworks-and-Brunetto-Latini","volume":"111"},

The only problem is, the assumptions these economists make to reach that conclusion are wrong. One crucial mistake involves mistaking the weather for the climate. Economists make their predictions based solely on the temperature changes in individual countries, ignoring the overall effects of climate change around the globe. Another glaring error is assuming that only those parts of the economy exposed to the outdoors will be adversely affected by climate change, ignoring how all production and economic activity is interconnected.

Thus far, the integrated assessment modelling community and the IPCC have neglected to consider degrowth scenarios, where economic output declines due to stringent climate mitigation. Hence, their potential to avoid reliance on negative emissions and speculative rates of technological change remains unexplored. As a first step to address this gap, this paper compares 1.5  °C degrowth scenarios with IPCC archetype scenarios, using a simplified quantitative representation of the fuel-energy-emissions nexus. Here we find that the degrowth scenarios minimize many key risks for feasibility and sustainability compared to technology-driven pathways, such as the reliance on high energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale carbon dioxide removal and large-scale and high-speed renewable energy transformation. However, substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility. Nevertheless, degrowth pathways should be thoroughly considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Keyßer","given":"Lorenz T."},{"family":"Lenzen","given":"Manfred"}],"citation-key":"keysserDegrowthScenariosSuggest20210511","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22884-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[20210511]]},"language":"en","page":"2676","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"1.5 °C degrowth scenarios suggest the need for new mitigation pathways","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22884-9","volume":"12"},

Par exemple, pour la sémiotique dite de l’Ecole de Paris, il s’agit de s’interroger sur l’éventuelle « ouverture » de l’héritage greimassien vers d’autres domaines tels que la phénoménologie ou la sociologie mais aussi de l’« ouverture » de l’objet sémiotique vers un mystérieux et informe « entour pragmatique » (c’était le thème traité par le séminaire parisien de sémiotique générale pendant l’année 2013-2014 : « Principe d’immanence et entour pragmatique »). Notons que ce souci d’ouverture n’est pas récent chez les analystes du langage. Déjà en 1980, Catherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni,dans son ouvrage de synthèse sur L’énonciation.

Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media.

With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different languages, we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6.5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide – what is black lives matter to one can be all lives matter to the other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"KhudaBukhsh","given":"Ashiqur R."},{"family":"Sarkar","given":"Rupak"},{"family":"Kamlet","given":"Mark S."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Tom M."}],"citation-key":"khudabukhshWeDonSpeak2020","container-title":"arXiv:2010.02339 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,18]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"We Don't Speak the Same Language: Interpreting Polarization through Machine Translation","title-short":"We Don't Speak the Same Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02339"},

Und auch das Klima, das in Politik und Gesellschaft unsere menschlichen Beziehungen prägt. Kaum verwunderlich, dass Tiefseeforscherin Antje Boetius und der frühere Bundestagspräsident Norbert Lammert schon durch ihren beruflichen Hintergrund ziemlich unterschiedliche Perspektiven einbringen können. Was aber passiert, wenn Wissenschaft und Politik gemeinsam nach Lösungen suchen, das gibt‘s dieses Mal zu hören. Ein Gespräch über Abenteurergeist, das Jobprofil für chinesische Regierungssprecher und eine gemeinsame Tauchfahrt fürs Weltklima.\n\nÜber die Gäste\n\nAntje Boetius ist Biologin, Tiefseeforscherin und Direktorin des Alfred-Wegener-Instituts für Polar- und Meeresforschung in Bremerhaven. 2019 erhielt sie von Bundespräsident Frank-Walter Steinmeier das Bundesverdienstkreuz für ihr Engagement zum Schutz der Ozeane. Sie nahm bis heute an fast 50 internationalen Forschungsexpeditionen teil. Ihr Ziel: Sie will mehr über den Einfluss der Ozeane auf Klima und Lebensvielfalt herausfinden und für die Folgen des Klimawandels sensibilisieren.\n\nNorbert Lammert war 37 Jahre lang Abgeordneter im Deutschen Bundestag - und für insgesamt drei Wahlperioden auch Bundestagspräsident. In dieser Funktion trat er für ein selbstbewusstes und unabhängiges Parlament ein, wachte aber auch streng über dessen Regeln und Redezeiten. Er ist Honorarprofessor an der Sozialwissenschaftlichen Fakultät der Ruhr-Universität-Bochum und seit 2018 Vorsitzender der CDU-nahen Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Klaus Tschira Stiftung","given":""}],"citation-key":"klaustschirastiftungTiefseeforscherinAntjeBoetius2020","container-title":"Treffen sich Welten","genre":"Podcast-Intro","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"title":"Tiefseeforscherin Antje Boetius trifft Ex-Bundestagspräsident Norbert Lammert - Treffen Sich Welten | Treffen Sich Welten","type":"webpage","URL":"https://treffensichwelten.de/klima/"},

  {"id":"knuttiLegacyOurCO22015","abstract":"Of the carbon dioxide that we emit, a substantial fraction remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years. Combined with the slow response of the climate system, this results in the global temperature increase resulting from CO2 being nearly proportional to the total emitted amount of CO2 since preindustrial times. This has a number of simple but far-reaching consequences that raise important questions for climate change mitigation, policy and ethics. Even if anthropogenic emissions of CO2 were stopped, most of the realized climate change would persist for centuries and thus be irreversible on human timescales, yet standard economic thinking largely discounts these long-term intergenerational effects. Countries and generations to first order contribute to both past and future climate change in proportion to their total emissions. A global temperature target implies a CO2 Bbudget^ or Bquota^, a finite amount of CO2 that society is allowed to emit to stay below the target. Distributing that budget over time and between countries is an ethical challenge that our world has so far failed to address. Despite the simple relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature, the consequences for climate policy and for sharing the responsibility of reducing global CO2 emissions can only be drawn in combination with judgments about equity, fairness, the value of future generations and our attitude towards risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Knutti","given":"Reto"},{"family":"Rogelj","given":"Joeri"}],"citation-key":"knuttiLegacyOurCO22015","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-015-1340-3","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","page":"361-373","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The legacy of our CO2 emissions: a clash of scientific facts, politics and ethics","title-short":"The legacy of our CO2 emissions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-015-1340-3","volume":"133"},

  {"id":"kobielaCO2neutralBis20352020","abstract":"Die in Paris Ende 2015 beschlossene Vereinbarung gibt das Ziel vor, die Erderwärmung bis 2100 auf deutlich unter 2 Grad Celsius zu begrenzen, möglichst aber auf unter 1,5 Grad Celsius. Die vorliegende Studie setzt sich mit der Frage von Fridays for Future Deutschland auseinander, welche Dimension von Veränderungen im deutschen Energiesystem erforderlich wären, um einen angemessenen Beitrag für das Erreichen der 1,5-Grad-Grenze leisten zu können. Nach Abschätzung des Weltklimarates, dem Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), lassen sich mit dieser Temperaturgrenze die Risiken und Auswirkungen des Klimawandels gegenüber einer stärkeren Erderwärmung erheblich verringern. Die Autorinnen und Autoren haben dabei den Budgetansatz des Sachverständigenrats für Umweltfragen (SRU) der Bundesregierung zugrunde gelegt. Um das 1,5-Grad-Ziel mit einer Wahrscheinlichkeit von 50 Prozent zu erreichen, ist das Restbudget an damit verträglichen Treibhausgasemissionen eng begrenzt. Für Deutschland bleibt gemäß des Sachverständigenrats für Umweltfragen ab dem Jahr 2020 noch ein Restbudget von 4,2 Gigatonnen CO2. Dabei geht der Sachverständigenrat von der Annahme aus, dass auf globaler Ebene jedem Menschen für die Zukunft ein gleiches Pro-Kopf-Emissionsrecht zugestanden werden soll. Mit dieser Klimaschutzvorgabe geht er deutlich weiter als die aktuellen politischen Vorgaben der Europäischen Union und der Bundesregierung, die diese für sich aus den Pariser Klimaschutzvereinbarungen ableiten. Die vom SRU formulierte Zielmarke lässt sich einhalten, wenn das Energiesystem (Energiewirtschaft, Industrie, Verkehr und Gebäudewärme) bis zum Jahr 2035 CO2-neutral aufgestellt wird und die Emissionen insbesondere in den nächsten Jahren bereits überproportional stark gesenkt werden können. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht die technische und in gewissem Maße auch die ökonomische Machbarkeit einer Transformation zur CO2-Neutralität bis 2035. Ob sich dieses Ziel jedoch tatsächlich realisieren lässt, hängt auch maßgeblich von der gesellschaftlichen Bereitschaft und einem massiven politischen Fokus auf die notwendige Transformation ab. Die Studie gibt somit Aufschluss darüber, inwiefern es grundlegende technologische und wirtschaftliche Hindernisse für die CO2-Neutralität 2035 gibt; nicht jedoch ob die Umsetzung realpolitisch tatsächlich gelingen kann bzw. was dafür im Einzelnen getan werden muss. Neben den technischen und ökonomischen Herausforderungen einer Transformation hin zu CO2-Neutralität bestehen zentrale Herausforderungen auch in institutioneller und kultureller Hinsicht, zum Beispiel bei Themen wie der Akzeptanz für einen starken Ausbau von Erneuerbaren-Energien-Anlagen und von Energieinfrastrukturen oder hinsichtlich der Notwendigkeit eines deutlich veränderten Verkehrsverhaltens.","author":[{"family":"Kobiela","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Samadi","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Kurwan","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Tönjes","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Fischedick","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Koska","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Lechtenböhmer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"März","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Schüwer","given":"Dietmar"}],"citation-key":"kobielaCO2neutralBis20352020","event-place":"Wuppertal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"de","page":"113","publisher":"Wuppertal Institut für Klima, Umwelt, Energie","publisher-place":"Wuppertal","title":"CO2-neutral bis 2035 : Eckpunkte eines deutschen Beitrags zur Einhaltung der 1,5-°C-Grenze ; Diskussionsbeitrag für Fridays for Future Deutschland","type":"report","URL":"http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:wup4-opus-76065"},

  {"id":"kopplEffectsEnvironmentalCarbon","abstract":"In view of the challenges posed by climate change and the increase in climate targets by 2030 in the EU, as well as Austria's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2040, the question of effective climate policy instruments is gaining in importance. The pricing of CO2, for instance in the form of a carbon tax, and the question of its effects are therefore attracting increasing attention in the academic as well as economic and environmental policy debate. The paper provides a detailed overview of the theoretical and empirical literature on the effects of carbon taxes. The focus is on the most important impact dimensions of carbon taxes: environmental effectiveness, effects on important macroeconomic variables (especially growth and employment), effects on innovation and competitiveness, distributional effects, and public acceptance.","author":[{"family":"Köppl","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Schratzenstaller","given":"Margit"}],"citation-key":"kopplEffectsEnvironmentalCarbon","language":"en","page":"51","source":"Zotero","title":"Effects of Environmental and Carbon Taxation.

  {"id":"latourActorNetworkTheoryFew2017","abstract":"Three resources have been developped over the ages to deal with agencies. The first one is to attribute to them naturality and to link them with nature. The second one is to grant them sociality and to tie them with the social fabric. The third one is to consider them as a semiotic construction and to relate agency with the building of meaning. The originality of science studies comes from the impossibility of clearly differentiating those three resources. Microbes, neutrinos of DNA are at the same time natural, social and discourse. They are real, human and semiotic entities in the same breath. The article explores the consequence of this peculiar situation which has not been underlined before science studies forced us to retie the links between these three resources. The actor-network theory developped by Callon and his colleagues is an attempt to invent a vocabulary to deal with this new situation. The article reviews those difficulties and tries ot overcome them by showing how they may be used to account for the consturction of entities, that is for the attribution of nature, society and meaning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"latourActorNetworkTheoryFew2017","container-title":"Philosophical Literary Journal Logos","container-title-short":"Logos","DOI":"10.22394/0869-5377-2017-1-173-197","ISSN":"08695377, 24999628","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"173-197","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On Actor-Network Theory.

  {"id":"latourExtendingDomainFreedom2019","abstract":"In this paper, two specialists of Gaia theory, one from the humanities and the other from Earth System Science, make a sustained effort to list the misunderstandings created by those who have either rejected or accepted Gaia too readily. They argue that the uniqueness of the phenomenon and of the arguments made by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis has been under-recognized. Neither mechanical nor organismic metaphors can render justice to the originality of Gaia. They show that the core of the discovery is to grant agency back to life forms and that Gaia is the highly complex result of their extension in space and duration in time. They conclude that Gaia is different from the concept of nature, a difference that opens a new way to look at the connection between biology and politics, which they define as extension of the domain of freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."}],"citation-key":"latourExtendingDomainFreedom2019","container-title":"Critical Inquiry","container-title-short":"Critical Inquiry","DOI":"10.1086/702611","ISSN":"0093-1896, 1539-7858","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","page":"659-680","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Extending the Domain of Freedom, or Why Gaia Is So Hard to Understand","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/702611","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"latourMixingHumansNonhumans1988","abstract":"Is sociology the study of social questions, or is it the study of associations? In this paper the author takes the second position and extends the study of our associations to nonhumans. To make the argument clearer, the author chooses one very humble nonhuman, a door-closer, and analyzes how this &quot;purely&quot; technical artifact is a highly moral, highly social actor that deserves careful consideration. Then the author proposes a vocabulary to follow human and nonhuman relations without stopping at artificial divides between what is purely technical and what is social. The author builds &quot;its&quot; or &quot;his&quot; own text in such a way that the text itself is a machine that exemplifies several of the points made by the author. In particular, the author is constructed and deconstructed several times to show how many social actors are inscribed or prescribed by machines and automatisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Latour","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"latourMixingHumansNonhumans1988","container-title":"Social Problems","issue":"35","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"298-310","title":"Mixing humans and nonhumans together: the sociology of a door-closer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/279"},

Here, we reconstruct the extent and surfaces of 14,798 Himalayan glaciers during the Little Ice Age (LIA), 400 to 700 years ago. We show that they have lost at least 40 % of their LIA area and between 390 and 586 km\n              3\n              of ice; 0.92 to 1.38 mm Sea Level Equivalent. The long-term rate of ice mass loss since the LIA has been between − 0.011 and − 0.020 m w.e./year, which is an order of magnitude lower than contemporary rates reported in the literature. Rates of mass loss depend on monsoon influence and orographic effects, with the fastest losses measured in East Nepal and in Bhutan north of the main divide. Locally, rates of loss were enhanced with the presence of surface debris cover (by 2 times vs clean-ice) and/or a proglacial lake (by 2.5 times vs land-terminating). The ten-fold acceleration in ice loss we have observed across the Himalaya far exceeds any centennial-scale rates of change that have been recorded elsewhere in the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Carrivick","given":"Jonathan L."},{"family":"Quincey","given":"Duncan J."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"James","given":"William H.

  {"id":"lentonOperationalisingPositiveTipping2022","abstract":"Non-technical summary\n              Transforming towards global sustainability requires a dramatic acceleration of social change. Hence, there is growing interest in finding ‘positive tipping points’ at which small interventions can trigger self-reinforcing feedbacks that accelerate systemic change. Examples have recently been seen in power generation and personal transport, but how can we identify positive tipping points that have yet to occur? We synthesise theory and examples to provide initial guidelines for creating enabling conditions, sensing when a system can be positively tipped, who can trigger it, and how they can trigger it. All of us can play a part in triggering positive tipping points.\n            \n            \n              Technical summary\n              Recent work on positive tipping points towards sustainability has focused on social-technological systems and the agency of policymakers to tip change, whilst earlier work identified social-ecological positive feedbacks triggered by diverse actors. We bring these together to consider positive tipping points across social-technological-ecological systems and the potential for multiple actors and interventions to trigger them. Established theory and examples provide several generic mechanisms for triggering tipping points. From these we identify specific enabling conditions, reinforcing feedbacks, actors and interventions that can contribute to triggering positive tipping points in the adoption of sustainable behaviours and technologies. Actions that can create enabling conditions for positive tipping include targeting smaller populations, altering social network structure, providing relevant information, reducing price, improving performance, desirability and accessibility, and coordinating complementary technologies. Actions that can trigger positive tipping include social, technological and ecological innovations, policy interventions, public investment, private investment, broadcasting public information, and behavioural nudges. Positive tipping points can help counter widespread feelings of disempowerment in the face of global challenges and help unlock ‘paralysis by complexity’. A key research agenda is to consider how different agents and interventions can most effectively work together to create system-wide positive tipping points whilst ensuring a just transformation.\n            \n            \n              Social media summary\n              We identify key actors and actions that can enable and trigger positive tipping points towards global sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Benson","given":"Scarlett"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Talia"},{"family":"Ewer","given":"Theodora"},{"family":"Lanel","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Petykowski","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Powell","given":"Thomas W.

Climate change and biosphere degradation have advanced to the point where we are already triggering damaging environmental tipping points, and to avoid worse ones ahead will require finding and triggering positive tipping points towards sustainability in coupled social, ecological and technological systems. To help with that I outline how tipping points can occur in continuous dynamical systems and in networks, the causal interactions that can occur between tipping events across different types and scales of system—including the conditions required to trigger tipping cascades, the potential for early warning signals of tipping points, and how they could inform deliberate tipping of positive change. In particular, the same methods that can provide early warning of damaging environmental tipping points can be used to detect when a socio-technical or socio-ecological system is most sensitive to being deliberately tipped in a desirable direction. I provide some example targets for such deliberate tipping of positive change.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."}],"citation-key":"lentonTippingPositiveChange2020","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"liSlowerDecayLandfalling2020","abstract":"When a hurricane strikes land, the destruction of property and the environment and the loss of life are largely confined to a narrow coastal area. This is because hurricanes are fuelled by moisture from the ocean1–3, and so hurricane intensity decays rapidly after striking land4,5. In contrast to the effect of a warming climate on hurricane intensification, many aspects of which are fairly well understood6–10, little is known of its effect on hurricane decay. Here we analyse intensity data for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes11 over the past 50 years and show that hurricane decay has slowed, and that the slowdown in the decay over time is in direct proportion to a contemporaneous rise in the sea surface temperature12. Thus, whereas in the late 1960s a typical hurricane lost about 75 per cent of its intensity in the first day past landfall, now the corresponding decay is only about 50 per cent. We also show, using computational simulations, that warmer sea surface temperatures induce a slower decay by increasing the stock of moisture that a hurricane carries as it hits land. This stored moisture constitutes a source of heat that is not considered in theoretical models of decay13–15. Additionally, we show that climate-modulated changes in hurricane tracks16,17 contribute to the increasingly slow decay. Our findings suggest that as the world continues to warm, the destructive power of hurricanes will extend progressively farther inland.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Chakraborty","given":"Pinaki"}],"citation-key":"liSlowerDecayLandfalling2020","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2867-7","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7833","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"page":"230-234","title":"Slower decay of landfalling hurricanes in a warming world","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2867-7","volume":"587"},

In this paper, I introduce an integrative method of analysis I devised called the “ecomediasphere.” The ecomediasphere prompts learners to explore the ecomedia object’s use and meaning from four different perspectives: lifeworld, culture, political economy, and materiality. Conceptually and theoretically, these four perspectives correspond with various lenses that inform digital media literacy and environmental literacy.","author":[{"family":"López","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"lopezECOMEDIALITERACYEDUCATING","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"ECOMEDIA LITERACY: EDUCATING WITH ECOMEDIA OBJECTS AND THE ECOMEDIASPHERE","type":"article-journal"},

These studies created new knowledge and tools for understanding and managing complex coupled human and natural systems. In this Critical Review, we used a topic modeling technique to analyze 12 526 peer-reviewed research articles and identify the research questions and the approaches that were used or developed in each of the studies. These approaches were then classiﬁed by function. The analysis revealed twenty-three categories of research questions and seven functional approach classesdesign for sustainability, modeling of complexity, sustainability indicators, life cycle sustainability assessment, decision making support, sustainability governance, and engagementeach of which is described here as an individual approach or tool within a larger sustainability toolbox.

Novel solutions that contribute to achieving energy savings in wired networks have been proposed to mitigate ongoing and alarming climate change and global warming. A detailed survey of relevant power-saving approaches in wired networks is presented here. We give a special focus on carrier-grade networks. At first we perform a comprehensive study of communication infrastructures regarding energy saving. Then, we highlight key issues to enable green networks, ranging from network design to network operation. After that, we present the major contributors to power consumption in wireline networks. Afterwards, we survey, classify, and compare the main energyaware methods and mechanisms that are the most appropriate for improving the energy efficiency of carrier-grade networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Maaloul","given":"Rihab"},{"family":"Chaari","given":"Lamia"},{"family":"Cousin","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"maaloulEnergySavingCarriergrade2018","container-title":"Computer Standards & Interfaces","container-title-short":"Computer Standards & Interfaces","DOI":"10.1016/j.csi.2017.04.001","ISSN":"09205489","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"8-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Energy saving in carrier-grade networks: A survey","title-short":"Energy saving in carrier-grade networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920548916301817","volume":"55"},

  {"id":"marksStreamingMediaEnvironmental2020","abstract":"This group of articles, which arose from a panel planned for the 2020 annual meeting of members of the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, draws attention to an unpopular but inescapable issue: the adverse environmental effects of streaming media. Four of these brief interventions focus on streaming media's carbon footprint, estimated by some to be 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (The Shift Project 2019). This startling figure is rising at a calamitous rate as more people around the world stream more media at higher bandwidth---now exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Another factor in streaming media's environmental impact is even less welcome: the deleterious effects of higher levels of electromagnetic frequencies that media corporations' turn to fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology would exacerbate. These effects are well documented yet almost universally ignored. Despite all these findings, the notion abides that digital media are immaterial. Laura U. Marks introduces the research challenges involved in calculating the carbon footprint of streaming media and suggests actions consumers and media makers can take to mitigate this environmental threat. Joseph Clark discusses the implications of digitizing huge amounts of archival film and connects material histories of news film production, distribution, and preservation or disposal to contemporary issues of digital storage, streaming, and energy use, using the newsreel archive as a case study. Jason Livingston's contribution expands on his droll and disturbing video lecture, which presents a speculative app for mobile phones that tracks streaming, correlates it to energy use and CO~2~ emissions, and suggests methods to mitigate usage. Denise Oleksijczuk introduces scientific research on the health and environmental impacts of high levels of electromagnetic frequencies and suggests ways, including creative practice, to break through the resistance to these findings among telecommunications companies, governments, and the public. Lucas Hilderbrand focuses on best practices in teaching: how to educate our students about these impacts, and how teachers can resist increasing pressures to use streaming-based pedagogical media. Many communities around the world already rely on low-tech media, of necessity, and are often extremely innovative in their use (Marks 2017). However, network and media corporations are aggressively marketing devices and streaming platforms in both \"developed\" and \"developing\" regions (Cisco 2020). Many of the latter regions depend on fossil fuels and cannot afford to prioritize renewable energy and efficient systems. Thus streaming media's carbon footprint is not just a First World problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Marks","given":"Laura U."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Livingston","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Oleksijczuk","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Hilderbrand","given":"Lucas"}],"citation-key":"marksStreamingMediaEnvironmental2020","container-title":"Media+Environment","container-title-short":"Media+Environment","DOI":"10.1525/001c.17242","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,15]]},"page":"17242","source":"mediaenviron.org","title":"Streaming Media’s Environmental Impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://mediaenviron.org/article/17242-streaming-media-s-environmental-impact","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"marshallDonEvenThink2014","abstract":"\"Most of us recognize that climate change is real, and yet we do nothing to stop it. What is this psychological mechanism that allows us to know something is true but act as if it is not? George Marshall's search for the answers brings him face-to-face with Nobel Prize-winning psychologists and the activists of the Texas Tea Party; the world's leading climate scientists and the people who denounce them; liberal environmentalists and conservative evangelicals. What he discovers is that our values, assumptions, and prejudices can take on lives of their own, gaining authority as they are shared, dividing people in their wake. With engaging stories and drawing on years of his own research, Marshall argues that the answers do not lie in the things that make us different and drive us apart, but rather in what we all share: how our human brains are wired--our evolutionary origins, our perceptions of threats, our cognitive blind spots, our love of storytelling, our fear of death, and our deepest instincts to defend our family and tribe. Once we understand what excites, threatens, and motivates us, we can rethink and reimagine climate change, for it is not an impossible problem. In the end, Don't even think about it is both about climate change and about the qualities that make us human and how we can grow as we deal with the greatest challenge we have ever faced\"--Jacket","author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"George"}],"call-number":"551.6","citation-key":"marshallDonEvenThink2014","edition":"First U.S. edition","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-62040-133-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn885302594","number-of-pages":"260","publisher":"Bloomsbury USA","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Don't even think about it: why our brains are wired to ignore climate change","title-short":"Don't even think about it","type":"book"},

  {"id":"marvelContinuoustimeModelStructural2011","abstract":"It is not uncommon for certain social networks to divide into two opposing camps in response to stress. This happens, for example, in networks of political parties during winner-takes-all elections, in networks of companies competing to establish technical standards, and in networks of nations faced with mounting threats of war. A simple model for these two-sided separations is the dynamical system dX/dt = X2, where X is a matrix of the friendliness or unfriendliness between pairs of nodes in the network. Previous simulations suggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: Either all relationships become friendly or two hostile factions emerge. Here we prove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possible outcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membership as a function of the initial conditions and implies that the initial amount of friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions) determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.","author":[{"family":"Marvel","given":"Seth A."},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Strogatz","given":"Steven H."}],"citation-key":"marvelContinuoustimeModelStructural2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1013213108","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"1771-1776","title":"Continuous-time model of structural balance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/5/1771.abstract","volume":"108"},

It proposes a maturity model and action framework for content strategy that is tightly tied to how these businesses are being developed and tests its applicability in a case study. Beyond these deliverables, this thesis also presents a perspective on how to connect business and content strategy to strengthen them both. Rooted in observations about business strategy frameworks and currently used content strategy approaches (especially for startups), the author visualises these strategies as interdependent sets of choices. She argues why content strategists need to make decisions on both levels and their influence on each other explicit. This research builds the theoretical basis for the proposed content strategy framework for bootstrapped businesses.

  {"id":"matiuObservedSnowDepth2021","abstract":"Abstract. The European Alps stretch over a range of climate zones which affect the spatial distribution of snow. Previous analyses of station observations of\nsnow were confined to regional analyses. Here, we present an Alpine-wide analysis of snow depth from six Alpine countries – Austria, France, Germany,\nItaly, Slovenia, and Switzerland – including altogether more than 2000 stations of which more than 800 were used for the trend assessment. Using a\nprincipal component analysis and k-means clustering, we identified five main modes of variability and five regions which match the climatic\nforcing zones: north and high Alpine, north-east, north-west, south-east, and south and high Alpine. Linear trends of monthly mean snow depth between\n1971 and 2019 showed decreases in snow depth for most stations from November to May. The average trend among all stations for seasonal (November to\nMay) mean snow depth was −8.4 % per decade, for seasonal maximum snow depth −5.6 % per decade, and for seasonal snow\ncover duration −5.6 % per decade. Stronger and more significant trends were observed for periods and elevations where the transition\nfrom snow to snow-free occurs, which is consistent with an enhanced albedo feedback. Additionally, regional trends differed substantially at the same\nelevation, which challenges the notion of generalizing results from one region to another or to the whole Alps. This study presents an analysis of\nstation snow depth series with the most comprehensive spatial coverage in the European Alps to date.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Matiu","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Crespi","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Bertoldi","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Carmagnola","given":"Carlo Maria"},{"family":"Marty","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Morin","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Schöner","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Cat Berro","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Chiogna","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"De Gregorio","given":"Ludovica"},{"family":"Kotlarski","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Majone","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Resch","given":"Gernot"},{"family":"Terzago","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Valt","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Beozzo","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Cianfarra","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Gouttevin","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Marcolini","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Notarnicola","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Petitta","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Scherrer","given":"Simon C."},{"family":"Strasser","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Zebisch","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Cicogna","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Cremonini","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Debernardi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Faletto","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Gaddo","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Giovannini","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Mercalli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Soubeyroux","given":"Jean-Michel"},{"family":"Sušnik","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Trenti","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Urbani","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Weilguni","given":"Viktor"}],"citation-key":"matiuObservedSnowDepth2021","container-title":"The Cryosphere","container-title-short":"The Cryosphere","DOI":"10.5194/tc-15-1343-2021","ISSN":"1994-0424","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,18]]},"language":"en","page":"1343-1382","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Observed snow depth trends in the European Alps: 1971 to 2019","title-short":"Observed snow depth trends in the European Alps","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/1343/2021/","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"mattioliPoliticalEconomyCar2020","abstract":"Research on car dependence exposes the difficulty of moving away from a car-dominated, high-carbon transport system, but neglects the political-economic factors underpinning car-dependent societies. Yet these factors are key constraints to attempts to ‘decouple' human well-being from energy use and climate change emissions. In this critical review paper, we identify some of the main political-economic factors behind car dependence, drawing together research from several fields. Five key constituent elements of what we call the ‘car-dependent transport system’ are identified: i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure; iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; iv) the provision of public transport; v) cultures of car consumption. Using the ‘systems of provision’ approach within political economy, we locate the part played by each element within the key dynamic processes of the system as a whole. Such processes encompass industrial structure, political-economic relations, the built environment, and cultural feedback loops. We argue that linkages between these processes are crucial to maintaining car dependence and thus create carbon lock-in. In developing our argument we discuss several important characteristics of car-dependent transport systems: the role of integrated sociotechnical aspects of provision, the opportunistic use of contradictory economic arguments serving industrial agendas, the creation of an apolitical façade around pro-car decision-making, and the ‘capture’ of the state within the car-dependent transport system. Through uncovering the constituents, processes and characteristics of car-dependent transport systems, we show that moving past the automobile age will require an overt and historically aware political program of research and action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattioli","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Steinberger","given":"Julia K."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"mattioliPoliticalEconomyCar2020","container-title":"Energy Research & Social Science","container-title-short":"Energy Research & Social Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2020.101486","ISSN":"22146296","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8]]},"language":"en","page":"101486","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The political economy of car dependence: A systems of provision approach","title-short":"The political economy of car dependence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214629620300633","volume":"66"},
  {"id":"mattioliTransportNeedsClimateconstrained2016","abstract":"The amount of energy and carbon emissions that is required to satisfy transport needs in developed countries is high, has increased rapidly in the past few decades, and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In some contexts, such as car-dependent peri-urban and rural areas, the satisfaction of basic needs has come to depend on extensive use of carbon-intensive transport modes. This creates a tension between social and environmental sustainability, and gives rise to justice dilemmas. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to conceptualise the connections and tensions between justice in transport and accessibility, on one hand, and the consequences of transport emissions on global and intergenerational justice, on the other hand. The framework is based on the integration of philosophical (human needs theory) and sociological (structuration theory) perspectives. While human needs are anthropological invariants, need satisﬁers are relative, contextual and historical. Over time, satisﬁers can become more travel- and carbon-intensive through unintentional structuration processes. This encourages a critical look towards how the role of transport in need satisfaction has changed over time, how it might change in the future, and the role of ‘excess travel’ practices in pushing the envelope of transport needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattioli","given":"Giulio"}],"citation-key":"mattioliTransportNeedsClimateconstrained2016","container-title":"Energy Research & Social Science","container-title-short":"Energy Research & Social Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.erss.2016.03.025","ISSN":"22146296","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"118-128","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transport needs in a climate-constrained world.

  {"id":"mayoSurprisingFactsProblem2014","abstract":"A common intuition about evidence is that if data x have been used to construct a hypothesis H, then x should not be used again in support of H. It is no surprise that x ﬁts H, if H was deliberately constructed to accord with x. The question of when and why we should avoid such ‘‘double-counting’’ continues to be debated in philosophy and statistics. It arises as a prohibition against data mining, hunting for signiﬁcance, tuning on the signal, and ad hoc hypotheses, and as a preference for predesignated hypotheses and ‘‘surprising’’ predictions. I have argued that it is the severity or probativeness of the test—or lack of it—that should determine whether a double-use of data is admissible. I examine a number of surprising ambiguities and unexpected facts that continue to bedevil this debate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mayo","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"mayoSurprisingFactsProblem2014","container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.10.005","ISSN":"00393681","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3]]},"language":"en","page":"79-86","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Some surprising facts about (the problem of) surprising facts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039368113001015","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"mazanderaniWholeWorldBecoming2018","abstract":"How to survive in this forest? How to keep it alive? Latour poses these questions in relation to the current global ecological crisis; but they are equally apt when applied to the “forest”––or to use Latour’s own metaphor, “biodiversity”––of STS. In his interview, Latour puts forward a particular vision for STS’s survival; a vision of STS as neither critical of nor ancillary to science, but where a tacit STS sensibility becomes integrated into science through education and collaboration. While Latour acknowledges the many differences of attitude and approach within STS, he also glosses over them, foregrounding as the defining feature of all those “infected” with STS the shared commitment to transforming science with the big “S” into something that can be studied empirically. The picture he paints is, unsurprisingly, a constructivist one, in which social and natural scientists, engineers, artists and politicians, “build worlds” together.

  {"id":"meansEvaluationEvidenceBasedPractices2010","abstract":"A systematic search of the research literature from 1996 through July 2008 identified more than \na thousand empirical studies of online learning. Analysts screened these studies to find those that \n(a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) measured student learning outcomes, (c) \nused a rigorous research design, and (d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect \nsize. As a result of this screening, 50 independent effects were identified that could be subjected \nto meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online learning \nconditions performed modestly better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. The \ndifference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face classes—measured as the \ndifference between treatment and control means, divided by the pooled standard deviation—was \nlarger in those studies contrasting conditions that blended elements of online and face-to-face \ninstruction with conditions taught entirely face-to-face. Analysts noted that these blended \nconditions often included additional learning time and instructional elements not received by \nstudents in control conditions. This finding suggests that the positive effects associated with \nblended learning should not be attributed to the media, per se. An unexpected finding was the \nsmall number of rigorous published studies contrasting online and face-to-face learning \nconditions for K–12 students. In light of this small corpus, caution is required in generalizing to \nthe K–12 population because the results are derived for the most part from studies in other \nsettings (e.g., medical training, higher education).","author":[{"family":"Means","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Toyama,","given":"Yukie"}],"citation-key":"meansEvaluationEvidenceBasedPractices2010","editor":[{"literal":"U.S. Department of Education"},{"literal":"Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development"},{"literal":"Policy and Program Studies Service"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"title":"Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in  Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and  Review of Online Learning Studies","type":"document"},
  {"id":"meashoAssessmentVegetationDynamics2021","abstract":"Understanding the response of vegetation and ecosystem resilience to climate variability and drought conditions is essential for ecosystem planning and management. In this study, we assessed the vegetation changes and ecosystem resilience in the Horn of Africa (HOA) since 2000 and detected their drivers based mainly on analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We found that the annual and seasonal trends of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) generally increased during the last two decades over the Horn of Africa particularly in western parts of Ethiopia and Kenya. The weakest annual and seasonal NDVI trends were observed over the grassland cover and tropical arid agroecological zones. The NDVI variation negatively correlated with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and positively correlated with precipitation at a significant level (p < 0.05) account for 683,197 km2 and 533,385 km2 area, respectively. The ecosystem Water Use Efficiency (eWUE) showed overall increasing trends with larger values for the grassland biome. The precipitation had the most significant effect on eWUE variation compared to LST and annual SPEI (Standardized Evapotranspiration Index). There were about 54.9% of HOA resilient to drought disturbance, whereas 32.6% was completely not-resilient. The ecosystems in the humid agroecological zones, the cropland, and wetland were slightly not-resilient to severe drought conditions in the region. This study provides useful information for policy makers regarding ecosystem and dryland management in the context of climate change at both national and regional levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Measho","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Baozhang"},{"family":"Pellikka","given":"Petri"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Lifeng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huifang"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Diwen"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Shaobo"},{"family":"Kayiranga","given":"Alphonse"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiaohong"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Mengyu"}],"citation-key":"meashoAssessmentVegetationDynamics2021","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs13091668","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1668","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessment of Vegetation Dynamics and Ecosystem Resilience in the Context of Climate Change and Drought in the Horn of Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1668","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"MeeresstromungImAtlantik","abstract":"05.08.2021 - Eine wichtige Strömung im Atlantik, zu der auch der Golfstrom gehört, hat im Laufe des letzten Jahrhunderts möglicherweise an Stabilität verloren. Das zeigt eine neue Studie im Fachjournal Nature Climate Change. Die Atlantische Umwälzströmung (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, AMOC) transportiert warme Wassermassen aus den Tropen an der Meeresoberfläche nach Norden und kaltes Wasser am Meeresboden nach Süden, was für die relativ milden Temperaturen in Europa von großer Bedeutung ist. Außerdem beeinflusst sie Wettersysteme weltweit. Ein möglicher Zusammenbruch dieses Meeresströmungssystems könnte daher schwerwiegende Folgen haben.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]]},"citation-key":"MeeresstromungImAtlantik","title":"Meeresströmung im Atlantik nähert sich möglicherweise kritischer Schwelle — Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.pik-potsdam.de/de/aktuelles/nachrichten/meeresstroemung-im-atlantik-naehert-sich-moeglicherweise-kritischer-schwelle"},

  {"id":"mitchellCarbonDemocracyPolitical2011","abstract":"\"Oil is a curse, it is often said, that condemns the countries producing it to an existence defined by war, corruption and enormous inequality. Carbon Democracy tells a more complex story, arguing that no nation escapes the political consequences of our collective dependence on oil. It shapes the body politic both in regions such as the Middle East, which rely upon revenues from oil production, and in the places that have the greatest demand for energy. Timothy Mitchell begins with the history of coal power to tell a radical new story about the rise of democracy. Coal was a source of energy so open to disruption that oligarchies in the West became vulnerable for the first time to mass demands for democracy. In the mid-twentieth century, however, the development of cheap and abundant energy from oil, most notably from the Middle East, offered a means to reduce this vulnerability to democratic pressures. The abundance of oil made it possible for the first time in history to reorganize political life around the management of something now called \"the economy\" and the promise of its infinite growth. The politics of the West became dependent on an undemocratic Middle East. In the twenty-first century, the oil-based forms of modern democratic politics have become unsustainable. Foreign intervention and military rule are faltering in the Middle East, while governments everywhere appear incapable of addressing the crises that threaten to end the age of carbon democracy-- the disappearance of cheap energy and the carbon-fuelled collapse of the ecological order.\"--Provided by publisher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"mitchellCarbonDemocracyPolitical2011","ISBN":"978-1-84467-896-9 978-1-306-91896-1 978-1-78168-393-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 882609648","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Carbon democracy: political power in the age of oil","title-short":"Carbon democracy","type":"book","URL":"http://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=5252115"},

  {"id":"mitchellRethinkingEconomy2008","abstract":"Rethinking economy requires rethinking the relationship between economics and its object. The economy is a recent product of sociotechnical practice, including the practice of academic economics. Previously, the term “economy” referred to ways of managing resources and exercising power. In the mid-twentieth century, it became an object of power and knowledge. Rival metrological projects brought the economy into being. The development of the modern electricity industry illustrates the kind of work involved. It required new technical processes, new forms of distribution, addressing, and monitoring, new forms of calculation that were simultaneously electrical, chemical, economic, and social. Analyses of how the economic is embedded in social ties or in cultural meanings cannot understand these intersecting projects. The projects that form the economy involve the work of economics. Economic knowledge does not represent the economy from some place outside. It participates in making sites where its facts can survive. The case of an economic research project on property rights in Peru illustrates how this happens. Economic facts were established in a world that was organized, through speciWc projects, such as the property titling programs of Hernando de Soto, to enable economic knowledge to be made. There is no simple divide between a virtual world of economic theory and a real world outside it. Every economic project involves multiple arrangements of the simulated and that to which it refers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"mitchellRethinkingEconomy2008","container-title":"Geoforum","container-title-short":"Geoforum","DOI":"10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.11.022","ISSN":"00167185","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1116-1121","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rethinking economy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016718506001904","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"mooreDeterminantsEmissionsPathways2022","abstract":"The ambition and effectiveness of climate policies will be essential in determining greenhouse gas emissions and, as a consequence, the scale of climate change impacts1,2. However, the socio-politico-technical processes that will determine climate policy and emissions trajectories are treated as exogenous in almost all climate change modelling3,4. Here we identify relevant feedback processes documented across a range of disciplines and connect them in a stylized model of the climate–social system. An analysis of model behaviour reveals the potential for nonlinearities and tipping points that are particularly associated with connections across the individual, community, national and global scales represented. These connections can be decisive for determining policy and emissions outcomes. After partly constraining the model parameter space using observations, we simulate 100,000 possible future policy and emissions trajectories. These fall into 5 clusters with warming in 2100 ranging between 1.8 °C and 3.6 °C above the 1880–1910 average. Public perceptions of climate change, the future cost and effectiveness of mitigation technologies, and the responsiveness of political institutions emerge as important in explaining variation in emissions pathways and therefore the constraints on warming over the twenty-first century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Frances C."},{"family":"Lacasse","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Mach","given":"Katharine J."},{"family":"Shin","given":"Yoon Ah"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Louis J."},{"family":"Beckage","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"mooreDeterminantsEmissionsPathways2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04423-8","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,16]]},"source":"www.nature.com","title":"Determinants of emissions pathways in the coupled climate–social system | Nature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04423-8"},

  {"id":"MultimodelAnalysisLongterm2021","abstract":"Most of the integrated assessment modelling literature focuses on cost-effective pathways towards given temperature goals. Conversely, using seven diverse integrated assessment models, we project global energy CO2 emissions trajectories on the basis of near-term mitigation efforts and two assumptions on how these efforts continue post-2030. Despite finding a wide range of emissions by 2050, nearly all the scenarios have median warming of less than 3 °C in 2100. However, the most optimistic scenario is still insufficient to limit global warming to 2 °C. We furthermore highlight key modelling choices inherent to projecting where emissions are headed. First, emissions are more sensitive to the choice of integrated assessment model than to the assumed mitigation effort, highlighting the importance of heterogeneous model intercomparisons. Differences across models reflect diversity in baseline assumptions and impacts of near-term mitigation efforts. Second, the common practice of using economy-wide carbon prices to represent policy exaggerates carbon capture and storage use compared with explicitly modelling policies. Mitigation pathways tend to focus on an end temperature target and calculate how to keep within these bounds. This work uses seven integrated assessment models to consider current mitigation efforts and project likely temperature trajectories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,8]]},"citation-key":"MultimodelAnalysisLongterm2021","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"source":"www.nature.com","title":"A multi-model analysis of long-term emissions and warming implications of current mitigation efforts | Nature Climate Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01206-3"},

  {"id":"nashClimateChangeActs2021","abstract":"Climate Change Acts (CCAs) have become a key legislative tool to mitigate climate change. While various case studies have shown that ambition varies greatly, little is known about why this is the case. This comparative study aims to ﬁll this gap by examining the emergence of six CCAs across four legislatures: Scotland (2009 and 2019), Austria (2011), Denmark (2014 and 2020) and Sweden (2017). We focus on climate change discourse broadly and processes of deliberation within legislatures speciﬁcally, to explore how they inﬂuenced the ambition of the six CCAs from our analysis. We combine extensive document analysis with 43 semi-structured interviews conducted between June 2018 and May 2019. We show that heightened attention at the discursive level combined with a strong deliberative process within legislatures to underpin all of the more ambitious CCAs. Overall, governments are more likely to adopt strong CCAs when prominent discursive junctures politicize climate policy and when parliamentary deliberation is strong. The overarching climate discourse and parliamentary deliberation had an even greater inﬂuence in our case studies than the political orientation of governments. Centre-left governments adopted weak GHG emission reduction targets at times of low political salience for climate but were more ambitious when supportive politicization of climate was present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Nash","given":"Sarah Louise"},{"family":"Steurer","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"nashClimateChangeActs2021","container-title":"Climate Policy","container-title-short":"Climate Policy","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2021.1962235","ISSN":"1469-3062, 1752-7457","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1120-1131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Climate Change Acts in Scotland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden: the role of discourse and deliberation","title-short":"Climate Change Acts in Scotland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2021.1962235","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"nesterovaSmallFirmsAgents2021","abstract":"For the majority of human existence as hunter-gatherers people managed to co-exist with nature. Historically, the impact of human economy on the environment, compared to the impact of natural forces, was small. Progression of human economies towards agriculture and industrial, fossil fuel powered, and growth orientated economies saw humanity transitioning to a state of environmental destruction and multiple species on the brink of extinction. To avoid collapse and sustain life on Earth, a transformation of economies by agents instead of the reproduction of current structures is urgently required. A new vision of economy should be based on the prin­ ciples of strong sustainability and post-growth. This paper identifies “radical” (pro-environ­ mental, pro-social, and values driven) small firms as agents of change towards such new economy. It aims to (1) identify a set of practices informed by primary data from seven in-depth case studies of radical British small firms carried out in Spring-Autumn 2018 which may assist with oper­ ationalisation of sustainable change, and (2) outline a path for facilitation of these practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Nesterova","given":"I."}],"citation-key":"nesterovaSmallFirmsAgents2021","container-title":"Futures","container-title-short":"Futures","DOI":"10.1016/j.futures.2021.102705","ISSN":"00163287","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"language":"en","page":"102705","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Small firms as agents of sustainable change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016328721000148","volume":"127"},

  {"id":"olefsChangesSnowDepth2020","abstract":"We used the spatially distributed and physically based snow cover model SNOWGRID-CL to derive daily grids of natural snow conditions and snowmaking potential at a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km for Austria for the period 1961–2020 validated against homogenized long-term snow observations. Meteorological driving data consists of recently created gridded observation-based datasets of air temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration at the same resolution that takes into account the high variability of these variables in complex terrain. Calculated changes reveal a decrease in the mean seasonal (November–April) snow depth (HS), snow cover duration (SCD), and potential snowmaking hours (SP) of 0.15 m, 42 days, and 85 h (26%), respectively, on average over Austria over the period 1961/62–2019/20. Results indicate a clear altitude dependence of the relative reductions (−75% to −5% (HS) and −55% to 0% (SCD)). Detected changes are induced by major shifts of HS in the 1970s and late 1980s. Due to heterogeneous snowmaking infrastructures, the results are not suitable for direct interpretation towards snow reliability of individual Austrian skiing resorts but highly relevant for all activities strongly dependent on natural snow as well as for projections of future snow conditions and climate impact research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Olefs","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Schöner","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Marke","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"olefsChangesSnowDepth2020","container-title":"Atmosphere","container-title-short":"Atmosphere","DOI":"10.3390/atmos11121330","ISSN":"2073-4433","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1330","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Changes in Snow Depth, Snow Cover Duration, and Potential Snowmaking Conditions in Austria, 1961–2020—A Model Based Approach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/11/12/1330","volume":"11"},

Several statistical and network analysis techniques were used to map and analyse these collaboration relationships at the country and institution level. Results show that The United States dominates the world scientific map and that every research institution is grouped by national, geographical and cultural criteria. A clustering phenomenon based on the self-similarity and fractal properties of scale-free networks is also observed.

  {"id":"ortegaMicrosoftAcademicSearch2014","abstract":"This paper aims to make a comparative analysis between the personal profiling capabilities of the two most important free citation-based academic search engines, namely Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) and Google Scholar Citations (GSC). Author profiles can be very useful for evaluation purposes once the advantages and the shortcomings of these services are described and taken into consideration. A total of 771 personal profiles appearing in both the MAS and the GSC databases are analysed. Results show that the GSC profiles include more documents and citations than those in MAS, but with a strong bias towards the Information and Computing sciences, while the MAS profiles are disciplinarily better balanced. MAS shows technical problems such as a higher number of duplicated profiles and a lower updating rate than GSC. It is concluded that both services could be used for evaluation proposes only if they are applied along with other citation indexes as a way to supplement that information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"José Luis"},{"family":"Aguillo","given":"Isidro F."}],"citation-key":"ortegaMicrosoftAcademicSearch2014","container-title":"Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/asi.23036","ISSN":"23301635","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1149-1156","source":"Crossref","title":"Microsoft academic search and Google scholar citations: Comparative analysis of author profiles: Microsoft Academic Search and Google Scholar Citations: Comparative Analysis of Author Profiles","title-short":"Microsoft academic search and Google scholar citations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/asi.23036","volume":"65"},

  {"id":"ottoSocialTippingDynamics2020","abstract":"Safely achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement requires a worldwide transformation to carbon-neutral societies within the next 30 y. Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth’s climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks). Our research reveals important areas of focus for larger-scale empirical and modeling efforts to better understand the potentials of harnessing social tipping dynamics for climate change mitigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Otto","given":"Ilona M."},{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."},{"family":"Cremades","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Bhowmik","given":"Avit"},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Lucht","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Allerberger","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"McCaffrey","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Doe","given":"Sylvanus S.

In this work, we present a study of a large collection of Twitter data centered on the social conversation around global climate change during the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, held in Paris, France in December 2015. We ﬁrst developed a mechanism for distinguishing between personal and non-personal accounts. We then analyzed demographics, emotion, and opinion dynamics over time and location in order to understand how the different user types converse around meaningful topics on social media. This methodology offers in-depth insight into the behavior and opinions around a topic where multiple distinct narratives are present involved, and lays the groundwork for future work in studying narratives in social media.","author":[{"family":"Pathak","given":"Neetu"},{"family":"Henry","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Volkova","given":"Svitlana"}],"citation-key":"pathakUnderstandingSocialMedia","language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Understanding Social Media's Take on Climate Change through Large-Scale Analysis of Targeted Opinions and Emotions","type":"article-journal"},

The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies’ ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Persson","given":"Linn"},{"family":"Carney Almroth","given":"Bethanie M."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Wit","given":"Cynthia A.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Diamond","given":"Miriam L."},{"family":"Fantke","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hassellöv","given":"Martin"},{"family":"MacLeod","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Ryberg","given":"Morten W."},{"family":"Søgaard Jørgensen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Villarrubia-Gómez","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhanyun"},{"family":"Hauschild","given":"Michael Zwicky"}],"citation-key":"perssonOutsideSafeOperating2022","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"pichlerTreibhausgasbudgetFurStadt2019","abstract":"Städte beherbergen weltweit bereits mehr als die Hälfte aller Menschen und sind für rund drei Viertel des globalen Energieverbrauchs und der Treibhausgasemissionen verantwortlich. Sie sind aber nicht nur Hauptverursacher des Klimaproblems, sondern können aufgrund ihrer Kapazitäten und Ressourcen zur Lösung des Problems entscheidend beitragen. Zur Sichtbarmachung wie sehr konkrete, klimapolitische Maßnahmen auf städtischer Ebene zu setzen sind, kann sowohl die Ausgangssituation, in Form von Treibhausgasbilanzen, analysiert und Ziele, in Form von einem Auskommen mit noch zulässigen Treibhausgasemissionen, dem sogenannten Treibhausgasbudget, abgesteckt werden. Durch den Einsatz der zwei zentralen, unterschiedlichen Bilanzierungsmethoden (produktions- und konsumseitig) werden in der vorliegenden Studie die der Stadt Graz zuzurechnenden Treibhausgasemissionen ermittelt, nach der produktionsseitigen Bilanzierung sind die für die Stadt Graz im Jahr 2015 Emissionen in Höhe von 1.170.210 t CO2äqu (4,1 t CO2äqu pro Kopf), nach der konsumseitigen Bilanzierung sind dies 2.770.730 t CO2äqu (9,7 t CO2äqu pro Kopf). Basierend auf diesen bilanzierten Treibhausgasemissionen ergibt sich ein Treibhausgasbudget für den Zeitraum von 2016 bis 2050 für Graz im Umfang von 42,75 Mio. t CO2äqu. Um mit diesem Budget auszukommen, müssen die Emissionen jährlich um durchschnittlich 5,6% sinken.\nDer vorliegende Bericht beschreibt die zugrunde liegenden Analysen im Detail und zeigt, dass effektiver Klimaschutz einer mannigfaltigen Politik auf allen Ebenen, in allen Bereichen des Lebens bedarf und nur durch Zusammenarbeit von Politik, Unternehmen und Konsumenten das Klima ausreichend umfangreich geschützt werden kann.","author":[{"family":"Pichler","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Steininger","given":"Karl W"}],"citation-key":"pichlerTreibhausgasbudgetFurStadt2019","event-place":"Graz","ISBN":"978-3-9504717-3-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"de","number-of-pages":"82","publisher":"Wegener Center Verlag","publisher-place":"Graz","source":"Zotero","title":"Das Treibhausgasbudget für die Stadt Graz","type":"book","URL":"https://www.umweltservice.graz.at/infos/andere/Treibhausgasbudget_Graz_2019.pdf"},

Ici le sémioticien fait le point sur la sémiotique des pratiques et sur le concept de formes de vie, sujet de son dernier ouvrage encore inédit. Au cours de ces conversations, qui prolongent celles réalisées en 2006 (PORTELA, 2006), Fontanille parle de la situation actuelle de la sémiotique en France, du rapport entre sémiotique et sciences humaines et du rôle de l’intellectuel dans la société. Selon J. Fontanille, la sémiotique doit faire face aux problématiques théoriques transversales et répondre aux questions sociétales, sans se focaliser seulement sur les apories et les questions internes aux courants sémiotiques en tant que regroupements institutionnels. Ainsi, le plus grand défi de la sémiotique à l’heure actuelle serait de chercher de nouvelles voies pour se réinventer en tant que discipline à vocation prédictive et stratégique.\n          , \n            This interview, carried out from February to May 2014, deals with the most recent developments of Jacques Fontanille’s work, French semiotician and one of the most prominent figures in European semiotics. In this testimony, the theorist revisits the semiotics of practices and the notion of forms of life, theme of his latest book, still unpublished. Throughout these conversations, which are a continuation of an interview performed in 2006 (PORTELA, 2006), Fontanille discusses the current state of semiotics in France, the relationship between semiotics and the human sciences and the role of the intellectual in society. For J. Fontanille, semiotics should seek to address crosscutting theoretical issues and respond to questions that are on the agenda in society, not focusing only on the aporias and on questions intrinsic to the semiotic currents as institutional groups.

  {"id":"portoEcologiaPoliticaEconomia2007","abstract":"Este trabalho busca trazer para o campo da Saúde Coletiva as contribuições da ecologia política e da economia ecológica, visando a integrar as discussões em torno da promoção da saúde, da sustentabilidade sócio-ambiental e dos processos de desenvolvimento. A economia ecológica é um campo de estudos transdisciplinar recente que reúne economistas com outros profissionais das ciências sociais, humanas e biológicas. Ela tem desenvolvido novos conceitos e metodologias que buscam captar a relação entre a economia com os processos ecológicos e sociais, como metabolismo social e perfil metabólico, inter-relacionando os fluxos econômicos com os de materiais e energia, e produzindo indicadores e índices de (in)sustentabilidade. A ecologia política, por sua vez, aborda as questões ecológicas e os conflitos sócio-ambientais a partir de dinâmicas econômicas e de poder que caracterizam as sociedades modernas. A Saúde Coletiva e as discussões sobre a promoção da saúde podem ampliar sua compreensão sobre o território, as comunidades, o papel da ciência e das instituições a partir das contribuições da ecologia política e da economia ecológica no entendimento dos modelos de desenvolvimento e os conflitos distributivos e sócio-ambientais por ele gerados.\n          , \n            This article proposes to focus contributions from political ecology and ecological economics to the field of collective health with a view towards integrating the discussions around health promotion, socio-environmental sustainability, and development. Ecological economics is a recent interdisciplinary field that combines economists and other professionals from the social, human, and life sciences. The field has developed new concepts and methodologies that seek to grasp the relationship between the economy and ecological and social processes such as social metabolism and metabolic profile, thereby interrelating economic, material, and energy flows and producing indicators and indexes for (un)sustainability. Meanwhile, political ecology approaches ecological issues and socio-environmental conflicts based on the economic and power dynamics characterizing modern societies.

  {"id":"quinnSearchPhoenicians2018","abstract":"Who were the ancient Phoenicians, and did they actually exist? The Phoenicians traveled the Mediterranean long before the Greeks and Romans, trading, establishing settlements, and refining the art of navigation. But who these legendary sailors really were has long remained a mystery. In Search of the Phoenicians makes the startling claim that the \"Phoenicians\" never actually existed. Taking readers from the ancient world to today, this monumental book argues that the notion of these sailors as a coherent people with a shared identity, history, and culture is a product of modern nationalist ideologies--and a notion very much at odds with the ancient sources. Josephine Quinn shows how the belief in this historical mirage has blinded us to the compelling identities and communities these people really constructed for themselves in the ancient Mediterranean, based not on ethnicity or nationhood but on cities, family, colonial ties, and religious practices. She traces how the idea of \"being Phoenician\" first emerged in support of the imperial ambitions of Carthage and then Rome, and only crystallized as a component of modern national identities in contexts as far-flung as Ireland and Lebanon. In Search of the Phoenicians delves into the ancient literary, epigraphic, numismatic, and artistic evidence for the construction of identities by and for the Phoenicians, ranging from the Levant to the Atlantic, and from the Bronze Age to late antiquity and beyond","author":[{"family":"Quinn","given":"Josephine Crawley"}],"call-number":"DS81 .Q56 2018","citation-key":"quinnSearchPhoenicians2018","collection-title":"Miriam S.

  {"id":"requena-i-moraSeeingEnvironmentalInjustices2021","abstract":"At the heart of any colonization project, and therefore any move to de-colonize, are ways of seeing nature and society, that then allow particular ways of governing each. This is plainly visible in a number of tools that exist to measure progress towards (or regress from) environmental sustainability. The tools use indices and indicators constructed mostly by environmental scientists and ecologists. As such, they are not neutral scientific instruments: they reflect the worldviews of their creators. These worldviews depend on three dimensions: the values they prioritize, the explanatory theories they use and the futures they envision. Through these means different tools produce conflicting notions of the sustainability of our economies and societies. In this article, we shed light onto the theoretical and epistemological assumptions that lie behind key international sustainability indices and indicators: the Environmental Performance Index,Domestic Material Consumption, Material Intensity, the Material Footprint, the Carbon Footprint, the Ecological Footprint and CO<sub>2 </sub> emissions (territorial). The variables included in these indices, the way they are measured, aggregated and weighted all imply a particular way of understanding the relationships between economy, society and environment. This divergence is most clearly visible in the fact that some indices are <i>negatively</i> correlated with each other. Where one index might plot growing environmental sustainability, another shows its decline. Our results highlight that those devices and the theories informing them are particularly interesting for way how colonialism is materialized. Some of these measurements hide the material roots of prosperity and the ecological (and economic) distributional conflicts exported to the poorer countries by the global North, and others show how its production and consumption levels are reliant upon a socio-ecological 'subsidy' imposed on Southern countries. These subsidies represent injustices that present a <i>primafacie</i> case for decolonizing indices and indicators of environmental governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Requena-i-Mora","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Brockington","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"requena-i-moraSeeingEnvironmentalInjustices2021","container-title":"Journal of Political Ecology","DOI":"10.2458/jpe.4765","ISSN":"1073-0451","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,21]]},"language":"eng","source":"journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu","title":"Seeing environmental injustices: the mechanics, devices and assumptions of environmental sustainability indices and indicators","title-short":"Seeing environmental injustices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu/jpe/article/id/4765/","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"rosierTippingPointsEarly2021","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is the main source of uncertainty in projections of future sea-level rise, with important implications for coastal regions worldwide. Central to ongoing and future changes is the marine ice sheet instability: once a critical threshold, or tipping point, is crossed, ice internal dynamics can drive a self-sustaining retreat committing a glacier to irreversible, rapid and substantial ice loss. This process might have already been triggered in the Amundsen Sea region, where Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers dominate the current mass loss from Antarctica, but modelling and observational techniques have not been able to establish this rigorously, leading to divergent views on the future mass loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we aim at closing this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic investigation of the stability regime of Pine Island Glacier. To this end we show that early warning indicators in model simulations robustly detect the onset of the marine ice sheet instability. We are thereby able to identify three distinct tipping points in response to increases in ocean-induced melt. The third and final event, triggered by an ocean warming of approximately 1.2 <span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span>C from the steady-state model configuration, leads to a retreat of the entire glacier that could initiate a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosier","given":"Sebastian H.

  {"id":"rossbachGeopoliticsRussianEnergy2018","abstract":"The risks of freezing in the dead of winter and the global economy crashing both have a lot to do with gas and oil – and with Russia. While its economy is only three times that of Sweden Russia is one of the world’s top exporters of both oil and gas. The income from energy exports is crucial for Russia’s defence spending and the country’s great power role. The exports also underpin Russia’s global influence. This underlines that energy has a lot to do with geopolitics. Europe is dependent on Russian gas and fears it will be cut off in a future worst-case scenario. The unexpected increase in US oil production following the shale revolution have brought Russia and Saudi Arabia together and made OPEC revert to its traditional role of increasing the oil price.","author":[{"family":"Rossbach","given":"Niklas"}],"citation-key":"rossbachGeopoliticsRussianEnergy2018","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11]]},"language":"en","number":"FOI-R--4623--SE","page":"88","publisher":"Swedish Defence Research Agency  (FOI)","source":"Zotero","title":"The Geopolitics of Russian Energy - Gas, oil and the energy security of tomorrow","type":"report","URL":"https://www.foi.se/rapportsammanfattning?reportNo=FOI-R--4623--SE"},

The challenge lies in satisfying the demand for digital devices for everyone, particularly for those with scarce resources, while preserving planetary limits. We have implemented and optimised a circular economy ecosystem that —through donation, refurbishment and traceability— delivers locally reused digital devices at a fair economic and environmental cost to citizens in need, providing satisfactory computing services and reducing the demand to manufacture new devices, which instead must be more durable. Following the sourcing of 10,000 computers, 1,000 have been successfully refurbished by local social enterprises and used by citizens in the city of Barcelona as a common good, herein we present an analysis of the achievements, limitations, and conditions of this model, which has already been replicated in other areas. It is feasible, and we also explore its scalability and sustainability in economic, social, and environmental contexts. We identify critical success factors, such as the roles of local public or private donors, social-support organisations, and ecosystem facilitators, in mediating among all actors involved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Roura","given":"Mireia"},{"family":"Franquesa","given":"David"},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Leandro"},{"family":"Meseguer","given":"Roc"}],"citation-key":"rouraCircularDigitalDevices2021","container-title":"LIMITS Workshop on Computing within Limits","DOI":"10.21428/bf6fb269.3881c46e","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Circular digital devices: lessons about the social and planetary boundaries","title-short":"Circular digital devices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://limits.pubpub.org/pub/ttw9ws0w"},

The concept goes beyond the environmental optimisation of products and processes and requires radical and creative thinking to reduce environmental impacts by a factor of between four and 20 times while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. Sustainable product-services consider alternative socio-technical systems that can provide the essential end-use function, such as warmth or mobility, that an existing product offers. Four types are outlined—result services; shared utilisation services; product-life extension services; and demand side management. Sustainable product-service systems attempt to create designs that are sustainable in terms of environmental burden and resource use, whilst developing product concepts as parts of sustainable whole systems, that provide a service or function to meet essential needs.","author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"roySustainableProductserviceSystems2000","container-title":"Futures","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-3287(99)00098-1","ISSN":"0016-3287","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"289-299","title":"Sustainable product-service systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328799000981","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"sanSocialNetworkingBrand2020","abstract":"In today‟s environment, societies are free to create and browse online content; marketers therefore to face vexing challenges in drawing expressive social media users to engage with their brands. This current group of users display postmodernism characteristics; i.e. need more for subjective experiences to achieve self-realization. Hence, the creation of consumer brand engagement among expressive social media societies is through content that should be able to provide these experiences. However, there is lack research study on this trend. The objective of this study was to evaluate passive experiential content that users perceived as novelty emotions (i.e. perceived creativity) that leads to intrinsic state of engagements (i.e. cognitive engagement and affective engagement) and to intentional engagement (the activation of willingness of brand clicking activities in social media). This, in turn, creates an advantage for the marketers because from this process if users engage the chances of building a long-term consumer brand engagement relationship is higher. This research study was done on 25-34 year-old Malaysian active expressive social media users who utilised expressive social media sites on a daily basis for at least 3 hours as the sample population from whom to collect data and administer a questionnaire survey with a still image as stimulus using social networking messaging platforms. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS and IBM AMOS software and results showed positive significant relationship within all the 7 constructs which were functional appeal, emotional appeal, vividness, perceived creativity, cognitive engagement, affective engagement and intentional engagement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"San","given":"Khaw Ooi"},{"family":"Sade","given":"Abu Bakar"},{"family":"Seduram","given":"Linda"}],"citation-key":"sanSocialNetworkingBrand2020","container-title":"International Business Research","container-title-short":"IBR","DOI":"10.5539/ibr.v13n4p63","ISSN":"1913-9012, 1913-9004","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"language":"en","page":"63","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Networking Brand Engagement using Creative Brand Content Experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ibr/article/view/0/42314","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"santariusDigitalizationDecouplingDebate2020","abstract":"Digitalization can increase resource and energy productivities. However, the production and usage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) require materials and energy, and the application of ICTs fosters economic growth. This paper examines whether digitalization helps or hinders an absolute decoupling of environmental throughput from economic growth. The paper combines the literature on “green IT” and “ICT for green” with studies on decoupling, i.e., the relationship between economic growth, technological change, and environmental throughput. The paper identifies several strains of the decoupling debate and connects them to the environmental implications of digitalization. We focus on the relation between digitalization and (1) the question of finite non-renewable energies, (2) the environmental Kuznets curve, (3) the role of energy consumption for economic growth, (4) efficiency improvements vis-à-vis rebound effects, and (5) the role of general purpose technologies for resource and energy demand. We find that the empirical basis regarding digitalization’s relation to these four aspects is still weak and hence, further research is needed. Comparing the mitigating and the aggravating impacts of digitalization, we conclude that a more active political and societal shaping of the process of digitalization is needed to make ICT work for global environmental sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Santarius","given":"Tilman"},{"family":"Pohl","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Steffen"}],"citation-key":"santariusDigitalizationDecouplingDebate2020","container-title":"Sustainability","container-title-short":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su12187496","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"7496","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digitalization and the Decoupling Debate: Can ICT Help to Reduce Environmental Impacts While the Economy Keeps Growing?","title-short":"Digitalization and the Decoupling Debate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/18/7496","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"saviniUrbanDegrowthHabitability2021","abstract":"Over the last decade, degrowth has offered a concrete alternative to eco-modernization, projecting a society emancipated from the environmentally destructive imperative of competition and consumption. Urban development is the motor of economic growth; cities are therefore prime sites of intervention for degrowth activists. Nevertheless, the planning processes that drive urban development have yet to be questioned from a degrowth perspective. To clear a path for a degrowth urban agenda, this paper rethinks the institutions governing urban development in growth-dependent contemporary economies. It starts by problematizing the regional territorialization of economic competition, ideology of land scarcity, and institution of zoned property rights, which together make urban development an engine of growth. It then outlines three transitions toward urban degrowth, arguing for a regional imaginary of polycentric autonomism, a paradigm of finity in development, and care for habitability as principle of spatial organization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Savini","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"saviniUrbanDegrowthHabitability2021","container-title":"Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space","container-title-short":"Environ Plan A","DOI":"10.1177/0308518X20981391","ISSN":"0308-518X, 1472-3409","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,12]]},"language":"en","page":"0308518X2098139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards an urban degrowth: Habitability, finity and polycentric autonomism","title-short":"Towards an urban degrowth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0308518X20981391"},

Dies hat einerseits mit dem Wandel durch die Digitalisierung von Medien und Gesellschaft zu tun – und andererseits mit der damit verbundenen Transformation und dem Bedeutungszuwachs ihres Forschungsgegenstands. Die Journalismusforschung hat sich aus dem Korsett „Kommunikatorforschung“ befreit, das ihr die allgemeine Kommunikationswissenschaft einst zugeschrieben hat: Mit neuem Selbstbewusstsein rückt sie einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz zur Erforschung und Analyse des Journalismus in der Gesellschaft in den Mittelpunkt. Sie entwickelt Theorien und Methoden weiter – und überdenkt ihr Verhältnis zum Journalismus. Diese Entwicklungen werfen einen neuen Bedarf an Selbstreflexion auf. Genau das hat die Fachgruppe Journalistik/Journalismusforschung der DGPuK auf ihrer Jahrestagung im September 2019 in Eichstätt getan. Unter dem Titel „Neujustierung der Journalistik/Journalismusforschung in der digitalen Gesellschaft“ gab die Eichstätter Tagung auch den Anstoß, ein Selbstverständnispapier zu entwickeln.

The best-known examples are rising sea levels due to disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets, or the release of methane deposits from the thawing Siberian permafrost. They help to underline the urgency of climate action. Today most people understand we must reduce emissions – and very quickly. In this webinar, Tim will summarise recent evidence regarding climate tipping points, which supports declarations that we are in a ‘climate emergency’. Then he will turn to identifying positive social tipping points that will need to be triggered to have any hope of limiting global warming to well below 2C.\n\nSpeaker: Prof. Tim Lenton is the Director of the Global Systems Institute and Chair in Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter. Tim and his group at Exeter focus on understanding the Earth as a system, modelling evolution, ecology, and biogeochemistry, providing early warning of climate tipping points, and identifying positive tipping points towards sustainability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,9]]},"citation-key":"scientistrebellionSRTalkSeries2022","dimensions":"1:15:46","director":[{"literal":"Scientist Rebellion"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"SR Talk Series | Positive tipping points to avoid climate tipping points — Prof. Tim Lenton","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqpmE_FQwpI"},

  {"id":"scobelWarumPhilosophieUnd2021","abstract":"Was haben Quantenphysik und Buddhismus gemeinsam? Und was haben Helgoland und Schrödingers Katze damit zu tun?\n\nCarlo Rovelli ist einer der weltweit führenden Quantenphysiker. Er befasst sich aber auch mit buddhistischen Philosophen wie Nagarjuna, über den Gert Scobel mit Rovelli spricht.\n\nWie seine berühmten Physik-Vorfahren Werner Heisenberg oder Max Planck schreibt Rovelli nicht nur über mathematisch sehr anspruchsvolle Gebiete der Physik wie beispielsweise der Schleifenquantengravitation. Er befasst sich auch mit Philosophie und Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Und so kommt er in seinem neuesten Buch auf die Verbindung von Philosophie und Quantenphysik.\n\nWie kann Philosophie der Wissenschaft dienen?\n\nWerner Heisenberg war 23, als er auf Helgoland die Quantenmechanik begründete. Er sah sich gezwungen eine Theorie zu entwickeln, die die Bewegungen der Elektronen in Atomen erklären würde, für die es zu dem Zeitpunkt noch keine schlüssige Antwort gab. Um der Lösung näher zu kommen, hinterfragte Heisenberg das Denken selbst.\n\nDie Philosophie entwickelte Begriffssysteme, die von Physikern wie Heisenberg verwendet wurden, um die Quantentheorie zu entwickeln.\n\nWie spielt der Beobachtende in die Beobachtung rein? Wer beobachtet ist immer Teil der Natur. Wenn alles miteinander interagiert, ist auch der Beobachtende Teil des Ganzen – Teil des Beobachtungsraums. Und darf somit sich selbst und seine Annahmen nicht außen vorlassen.\n\n\n\n\nLinks und Quellen:\n\nCarlo Rovelli: Helgoland. Wie die Quantentheorie unsere Welt verändert, 2021\nCarlo Rovelli: Die Wirklichkeit, die nicht so ist, wie sie scheint: Eine Reise in die Welt der Quantengravitation\nCarlo Rovelli: Sieben kurze Lektionen über Physik, 2014\n\nhttps://www.spektrum.de/news/quantenf...\n\n\n\nRaum & Zeit – Was Physik von Philosophie lernen kann\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFPrN...\n\nHat das Universum ein Bewusstsein?

Without clear definition, however, these targets risk being reliant on using vast swathes of land in low-income countries to capture carbon emissions, allowing the biggest emitters to avoid making significant cuts in their own emissions. ‘Net zero’ could end up being a dangerous distraction that could delay the rapid reductions in emissions that high-emitting countries and companies need to make if we are to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. It could also lead to an explosion in demand for land which, if not subject to careful safeguards, might risk increasing hunger and fuelling land inequality. Net zero should be a pathway to real and transformative climate action and not greenwash. Carbon emissions need to be reduced now, and land-based climate solutions must centre ‘food-first’ approaches that help achieve both zero emissions and zero hunger.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Dabi","given":"Nafkote"}],"citation-key":"senTighteningNetNet2021","DOI":"10.21201/2021.7796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"language":"en","page":"42","publisher":"Oxfam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tightening the Net: Net zero climate targets – implications for land and food equity","title-short":"Tightening the Net","type":"report","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10546/621205"},

  {"id":"sharpeUpwardscalingTippingCascades2021","abstract":"Limiting global warming to well below 2°C requires a dramatic acceleration of decarbonisation to reduce net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero by mid-century. In complex systems – including human societies – tipping points can occur, in which a small perturbation transforms a system. Crucially, activating one tipping point can increase the likelihood of triggering another at a larger scale, and so on. Here we show how such upward-scaling tipping cascades could accelerate progress in tackling climate change. We focus on two sectors – light road transport and power – where tipping points have already been triggered by policy interventions at individual nation scales. We show how positive-sum cooperation, between small coalitions of jurisdictions and their policymakers, could lead to global changes in the economy and emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."}],"citation-key":"sharpeUpwardscalingTippingCascades2021","container-title":"Climate Policy","container-title-short":"Climate Policy","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2020.1870097","ISSN":"1469-3062, 1752-7457","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"language":"en","page":"421-433","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Upward-scaling tipping cascades to meet climate goals: plausible grounds for hope","title-short":"Upward-scaling tipping cascades to meet climate goals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2020.1870097","volume":"21"},

Our age's new technologies of social networking are evolving, and evolving us, into new groups doing new things in new ways, and old and new groups alike doing the old things better and more easily. Hierarchical structures that exist to manage the work of groups are seeing their raisons d'e^tre swiftly eroded by the rising tide. Business models are being destroyed, transformed, born at dizzying speeds, and the larger social impact is profound. Clay Shirky is one of our wisest observers of the transformational power of the new forms of tech-enabled social interaction, and this is his reckoning with the ramifications of all this on what we do and who we are.--From publisher description.

  {"id":"silvaIslamabadToday2021","abstract":"In 1962, the architecture practice Ponti Fornaroli Rosselli was commissioned to design and build part of the Ministries area of the new capital of West Pakistan, Islamabad, which was under construction according to Constantinos Doxiadis and Robert Matthew?s master plan. Fifteen hundred architecture drawings and less than two years later, the buildings were completed. At some moments, five thousand workers were on site at the same time. Project manager Alberto Rosselli declared that the idea was not to transfer their Western knowledge to Pakistan, but to create a new Pakistan. Moved by this incredible project, where the personal stories of the Ponti and Rosselli families crossed paths against a backdrop of architectural and political history, Giovanna Silva traveled to Islamabad in 2020 with Paolo Rosselli, nephew of Gio Ponti and son of Alberto Rosselli. It was a journey through architecture, personal memories, and a city built in the desert as a future capital of a new world, against the beautiful scenery of the Margalla Hills. Silva?s photographs show the buildings in their everyday public function, with a focus on the spaces as performed by their users. The book also features archival images of the building site and construction, and a narrative text by Paolo Rosselli tracing the story of the project and his reactions during his first visit to his father?s work in Islamabad.","author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Rosselli","given":"Paolo"}],"citation-key":"silvaIslamabadToday2021","event-place":"Milan","ISBN":"978-88-6749-457-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1247686426","publisher":"Mousse Publishing","publisher-place":"Milan","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Islamabad today","type":"book"},

  {"id":"solomonIrreversibleClimateChange2009","abstract":"The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6–1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.","author":[{"family":"Solomon","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Plattner","given":"Gian-Kasper"},{"family":"Knutti","given":"Reto"},{"family":"Friedlingstein","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"solomonIrreversibleClimateChange2009","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0812721106","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"1704–1709","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","title":"Irreversible climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/106/6/1704","volume":"106"},

Unravelling the flaws in the arguments, contradictions and underlying motives requires both understand of and cutting through the specialist language, neoclassical economic models, mathematics and rhetoric. We offer a critical guide to and deconstruction of Dasgupta’s biodiversity economics and reveal its real aim. Framing critical biodiversity loss as an issue of asset management and population size is a blind to avoid questioning economic growth, which remains unchallenged and depoliticized despite apparently recognizing natural limits. Dasgupta ignores long-standing problems with capital theory and social cost–benefit analysis. Rather than a scientific review of biodiversity economics he offers impossible to achieve valuation, based on old flawed theories and methods, embedded in an unsavoury political economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Spash","given":"Clive L."},{"family":"Hache","given":"Frédéric"}],"citation-key":"spashDasguptaReviewDeconstructed2021","container-title":"Globalizations","DOI":"10.1080/14747731.2021.1929007","ISSN":"1474-7731","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"page":"1-24","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Dasgupta Review deconstructed: an exposé of biodiversity economics","title-short":"The Dasgupta Review deconstructed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2021.1929007","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"spashSocialEcologicalEconomics2011","abstract":"The attempt to provide insight into the interactions between the economy and the environment has been an on-going struggle for many decades. The rise of Ecological Economics can be seen as a positive step towards integrating social and natural science understanding by a movement that aims to go beyond the conﬁnes of mainstream economics towards a progressive political economy of the environment. However, this vision has not been shared by all those who have associated themselves with Ecological Economics and there has been conﬂict. An historical analysis is presented that shows the role of mainstream theory in delimiting the ﬁeld of environmental research. The argument is put forward that rather than employing a purely mechanistic objective empirical methodology there is a need for an integrating interdisciplinarity heterodox economic approach. In order to distinguish this approach—from the more mainstream multidisciplinary linking of unreconstituted ecological and economic models—the name Social Ecological Economics is put forward as expressing the essential socio-economic character of the needed work ahead.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Spash","given":"Clive L."}],"citation-key":"spashSocialEcologicalEconomics2011","container-title":"American Journal of Economics and Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1536-7150.2011.00777.x","ISSN":"00029246","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4]]},"language":"en","page":"340-375","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Ecological Economics: Understanding the Past to See the Future: Social Ecological Economics","title-short":"Social Ecological Economics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1536-7150.2011.00777.x","volume":"70"},

Introduction (00:00) Sunny Morgan's talk (04:34) Juan Pablo Osson's talk (14:54) Louise Wagner's talk (26:58) Esteban Servat's talk (35:44) Q&amp;A (41:40) Abstract: Debt for Climate (https://debtforclimate.org/) is a grassroots, Global South-driven initiative connecting social &amp; climate justice struggles by uniting labor, social and climate movements from the Global South &amp; North toward a common goal of turning debt-trap diplomacy on its head by canceling the debt of impoverished nations as a way to pay for leaving fossil fuels in the ground and financing a just transition. The implementation of a global Debt for Climate initiative has the potential to leave trillions of dollars in fossil fuel reserves in the ground, while freeing countries from a strangling debt burden often used as a tool for further extraction of natural resources. We are organizing a global action to push these demands during the G7 meeting on June 26-28. Join this talk to learn more! Speakers: Sunny Morgan, aka Sunny the Solar Guy, is a climate justice activist from South Africa and works with various organisations such as Extinction Rebellion South Africa, the Climate Justice Charter Movement and African Climate Reality Project. He is also the founder of a solar renewable energy business. Juan Pablo Osson is a specialist in economic-social, environmental, global warming and geopolitical issues, lectures on The Challenges of Argentina and Latin America in the face of Global Warming and the World Water Crisis for Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO). He is a coordinator in Latin America of the Progressive International movement. Louise Wagner studied environmental Sociology at the University of Jena and joined the environmental justice movement in 2017. She organized with Ende Gelände on a national level and sees power in organising across movements and borders to build connections on respect and solidarity. Esteban Servat is a biotechnologist, environmental activist and founder of Ecoleaks. Born in Argentina, he had to leave the country after denouncing fracking and mega-mining in Mendoza. He participates with the global movements Shale Must Fall and Debt for Climate.

  {"id":"stantonDecisionMakingDeep2021","abstract":"Deep uncertainties like environmental and socio-economic changes create challenges to decision making. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) methods are recognised approaches to navigate deep uncertainties and support robust and adaptable decisions. However, their ability to fully reflect the context in which these decisions are made has been criticised. This paper presents a synthesis across cases and methods to provide a holistic understanding of the application of DMDU methods to support long-term decision making. We carried out a structured literature review and analysed 37 infrastructure DMDU case studies. The analysis shows that DMDU methods are effective at developing plans to address a range of deep uncertainties and in some cases, reflecting the institutional context of the decision. However, they largely overlook the organisational and individual contexts in which decision making happens. We argue that the use of existing DMDU methods in practice should start with a better understanding of the institutional, organisational and individual contexts. We then suggest modifications to the applications of DMDU methods, i.e. internalising the context at different stages of the decision-making process and developing a decision typology to signpost decision makers to the best approach for a specific context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanton","given":"Muriel C.

  {"id":"steculaFramingClimateChange2019","abstract":"The news media play an inﬂuential role in shaping public attitudes on a wide range of issues—climate change included. As climate change has risen in salience, the average American is much more likely to be exposed to news coverage now than in the past. Yet, we don’t have a clear understanding of how the content of this news coverage has changed over time, despite likely playing an important part in fostering or inhibiting public support and engagement in climate action. In this paper we use a combination of automated and manual content analysis of the most inﬂuential media sources in the U.S. -the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Associated Press- to illustrate the prevalence of different frames in the news coverage of climate change and their dynamics over time from the start of the climate change debate in 1988. Speciﬁcally, we focus on three types of frames, based on previous research: economic costs and beneﬁts associated with climate mitigation, appeals to conservative and free market values and principles, and uncertainties and risk surrounding climate change. We ﬁnd that many of the frames found to reduce people’s propensity to support and engage in climate action have been on the decline in the mainstream media, such as frames emphasizing potential economic harms of climate mitigation policy or uncertainty. At the same time, frames conducive to such engagement by the general public have been on the rise, such as those highlighting economic beneﬁts of climate action. News content is also more likely now than in the past to use language emphasizing risk and danger, and to use the present tense. To the extent that media framing plays an important role in fostering climate action in the public, these are welcome developments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Stecula","given":"Dominik A."},{"family":"Merkley","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"steculaFramingClimateChange2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Communication","container-title-short":"Front.

Here, we discuss the emergence and evolution of ESS, outlining the importance of these developments in advancing our understanding of global change. Inspired by early work on biosphere–geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new ‘science of the Earth’. The International Geosphere-B iosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-c hange discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Schellnhuber","given":"Hans Joachim"},{"family":"Dube","given":"Opha Pauline"},{"family":"Dutreuil","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Lubchenco","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"steffenEmergenceEvolutionEarth2020","container-title":"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43017-019-0005-6","ISSN":"2662-138X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","page":"54-63","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The emergence and evolution of Earth System Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0005-6","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"steffenTrajectoriesEarthSystem2018","abstract":"We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause continued warming on a “Hothouse Earth” pathway even as human emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Folke","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Liverman","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Summerhayes","given":"Colin P."},{"family":"Barnosky","given":"Anthony D."},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Crucifix","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."},{"family":"Fetzer","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Lade","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Winkelmann","given":"Ricarda"},{"family":"Schellnhuber","given":"Hans Joachim"}],"citation-key":"steffenTrajectoriesEarthSystem2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1810141115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"33","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,14]]},"language":"en","page":"8252-8259","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115","volume":"115"},
  {"id":"steffenTrajectoryAnthropoceneGreat2015a","abstract":"The “Great Acceleration” graphs, originally published in 2004 to show socioeconomic and Earth System trends from 1750 to 2000, have now been updated to 2010. In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socioeconomic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world’s economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, postindustrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Broadgate","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Gaffney","given":"Owen"},{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Cornelia"}],"citation-key":"steffenTrajectoryAnthropoceneGreat2015a","container-title":"The Anthropocene Review","container-title-short":"The Anthropocene Review","DOI":"10.1177/2053019614564785","ISSN":"2053-0196, 2053-020X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4]]},"language":"en","page":"81-98","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The trajectory of the Anthropocene: The Great Acceleration","title-short":"The trajectory of the Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614564785","volume":"2"},

Exploring this rise through nine thematic lenses—covering issues of climate governance, the fossil fuel industry, geopolitics, economics, mitigation modeling, energy systems, inequity, lifestyles, and social imaginaries—draws out multifaceted reasons for our collective failure to bend the global emissions curve. However, a common thread that emerges across the reviewed literature is the central role of power, manifest in many forms, from a dogmatic political-economic hegemony and influential vested interests to narrow techno-economic mindsets and ideologies of control. Synthesizing the various impediments to mitigation reveals how delivering on the commitments enshrined in the Paris Agreement now requires an urgent and unprecedented transformation away from today's carbon- and energy-intensive development paradigm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Stoddard","given":"Isak"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Capstick","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Carton","given":"Wim"},{"family":"Depledge","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Facer","given":"Keri"},{"family":"Gough","given":"Clair"},{"family":"Hache","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Hoolohan","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Hultman","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hällström","given":"Niclas"},{"family":"Kartha","given":"Sivan"},{"family":"Klinsky","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Kuchler","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Lövbrand","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Nasiritousi","given":"Naghmeh"},{"family":"Newell","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Sokona","given":"Youba"},{"family":"Stirling","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Stilwell","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Spash","given":"Clive L."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Mariama"}],"citation-key":"stoddardThreeDecadesClimate2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","container-title-short":"Annu.

Full of alarming ideas (ghost waves, distant objects that seem to be magically connected, cats that appear both dead and alive), quantum physics has led to countless discoveries and technological advancements. Today our understanding of the world is based on this theory, yet it is still profoundly mysterious.\n\nAs scientists and philosophers continue to fiercely debate the meaning of the theory, Rovelli argues that its most unsettling contradictions can be explained by seeing the world as fundamentally made of relationships rather than substances. We and everything around us exist only in our interactions with one another. This bold idea suggests new directions for thinking about the structure of reality and even the nature of consciousness. Rovelli makes learning about quantum mechanics an almost psychedelic experience. Shifting our perspective once again, he takes us on a riveting journey through the universe so we can better comprehend our place in it.\n\nCarlo Rovelli is a theoretical physicist who has made significant contributions to the physics of space and time. He has worked in Italy and the United States, and is currently directing the Quantum Gravity research group of the Centre de Physique Théorique in Marseille, France. His books \"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics\", \"Reality Is Not What It Seems\", and \"The Order of Time\" are international bestsellers that have been translated into more than forty languages.\n\nGet the book here: https://goo.gle/2SMPoJR.\n\nModerated by Sanders Kleinfeld.\n\n#quantumtheory #quantumphysics #carlorovelli","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,30]]},"citation-key":"talksatgoogleCarloRovelliHelgoland2021","dimensions":"1:01:08","director":[{"literal":"Talks at Google"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,15]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"Carlo Rovelli | Helgoland: Making Sense of the Quantum Revolution | Talks at Google","title-short":"Carlo Rovelli | Helgoland","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWf2wyGQ0Q"},
  {"id":"tanakaRecentNormalizationHistorical2022","abstract":"Climate change exposes marine ecosystems to extreme conditions with increasing frequency. Capitalizing on the global reconstruction of sea surface temperature (SST) records from 1870-present, we present a centennial-scale index of extreme marine heat within a coherent and comparable statistical framework. A spatially (1° × 1°) and temporally (monthly) resolved index of the normalized historical extreme marine heat events was expressed as a fraction of a year that exceeds a locally determined, monthly varying 98\n              th\n              percentile of SST gradients derived from the first 50 years of climatological records (1870–1919). For the year 2019, our index reports that 57% of the global ocean surface recorded extreme heat, which was comparatively rare (approximately 2%) during the period of the second industrial revolution. Significant increases in the extent of extreme marine events over the past century resulted in many local climates to have shifted out of their historical SST bounds across many economically and ecologically important marine regions. For the global ocean, 2014 was the first year to exceed the 50% threshold of extreme heat thereby becoming “normal”, with the South Atlantic (1998) and Indian (2007) basins crossing this barrier earlier. By focusing on heat extremes, we provide an alternative framework that may help better contextualize the dramatic changes currently occurring in marine systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Kisei R."},{"family":"Van Houtan","given":"Kyle S."}],"citation-key":"tanakaRecentNormalizationHistorical2022","container-title":"PLOS Climate","container-title-short":"PLOS Clim","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pclm.0000007","editor":[{"family":"deCastro","given":"Maite"}],"ISSN":"2767-3200","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e0000007","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The recent normalization of historical marine heat extremes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000007","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"tipperGlobalSilicateWeathering2021","abstract":"Significance\n\nLarge rivers transport water and sediment to floodplains and oceans, supplying the nutrients that sustain life. They also transport carbon, removed from the atmosphere during mineral dissolution reactions, which is thought to provide a key negative climate feedback on long timescales. We demonstrate that the (million-year) carbon flux associated with mineral dissolution has been overestimated by up to 28% because of a reactive pool of elements transported with river-borne suspended sediment. This is most acute in regions of high erosion, where silicate weathering is thought to be most intense.\nAbstract\n\nRivers carry the dissolved and solid products of silicate mineral weathering, a process that removes CO2\nfrom the atmosphere and provides a key negative climate feedback over geological timescales. Here we show that, in some river systems, a reactive exchange pool on river suspended particulate matter, bonded weakly to mineral surfaces, increases the mobile cation flux by 50%. The chemistry of both river waters and the exchange pool demonstrates exchange equilibrium, confirmed by Sr isotopes. Global silicate weathering fluxes are calculated based on riverine dissolved sodium (Na+) from silicate minerals. The large exchange pool supplies Na+ of nonsilicate origin to the dissolved load, especially in catchments with widespread marine sediments, or where rocks have equilibrated with saline basement fluids. We quantify this by comparing the riverine sediment exchange pool and river water chemistry. In some basins, cation exchange could account for the majority of sodium in the river water, significantly reducing estimates of silicate weathering. At a global scale, we demonstrate that silicate weathering fluxes are overestimated by 12 to 28%. This overestimation is greatest in regions of high erosion and high sediment loads where the negative climate feedback has a maximum sensitivity to chemical weathering reactions. In the context of other recent findings that reduce the net CO2 consumption through chemical weathering, the magnitude of the continental silicate weathering fluxes and its implications for solid Earth CO2 degassing fluxes need to be further investigated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Tipper","given":"Edward T."},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Emily I."},{"family":"Alcock","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Knight","given":"Alasdair C.

In this article I draw on AIME in order to respond to criticisms of actor-network theory that derive from broader sociological and philosophical standpoints. I argue that actor-network theory should now only be understood as an integral aspect of Latour’s newer inquiry, and ought no longer to be considered in isolation but instead as being integrated within a critical as well as pragmatic reading of Latour’s AIME project.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tummons","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"tummonsOntologicalPluralismModes2021","container-title":"Social Epistemology","container-title-short":"Social Epistemology","DOI":"10.1080/02691728.2020.1774815","ISSN":"0269-1728, 1464-5297","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ontological Pluralism, Modes of Existence, and Actor-Network Theory: Upgrading Latour with Latour","title-short":"Ontological Pluralism, Modes of Existence, and Actor-Network Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02691728.2020.1774815","volume":"35"},

It is a credibility test for global efforts to address climate change and it is where Parties must make considerable progress to reach consensus on issues they have been discussing for several years. COP 26 comes against the background of widespread, rapid and intensifying climate change impacts, which are already impacting every region on Earth. Also, COP 26 comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the urgent need to build back better for present future generations to ensure a safe future.\n\nThe UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.\n\n\n#COP26 #UNClimateChange #VanessaNakate","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"citation-key":"unclimatechangeClimateActivistVanessa2021","dimensions":"7:14","director":[{"literal":"UN Climate Change"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,11]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"Climate Activist Vanessa Nakate at COP26: \"Humanity will not be saved by promises\"","title-short":"Climate Activist Vanessa Nakate at COP26","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeLWEbvXzSA"},

  {"id":"vanoldenborghPathwaysPitfallsExtreme2021","abstract":"The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in extreme event attribution, the science of estimating the influence of human activities or other factors on the probability and other characteristics of an observed extreme weather or climate event. This is driven by public interest, but also has practical applications in decision-making after the event and for raising awareness of current and future climate change impacts. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) collaboration has over the last 5 years developed a methodology to answer these questions in a scientifically rigorous way in the immediate wake of the event when the information is most in demand. This methodology has been developed in the practice of investigating the role of climate change in two dozen extreme events world-wide. In this paper, we highlight the lessons learned through this experience. The methodology itself is documented in a more extensive companion paper. It covers all steps in the attribution process: the event choice and definition, collecting and assessing observations and estimating probability and trends from these, climate model evaluation, estimating modelled hazard trends and their significance, synthesis of the attribution of the hazard, assessment of trends in vulnerability and exposure, and communication. Here, we discuss how each of these steps entails choices that may affect the results, the common problems that can occur and how robust conclusions can (or cannot) be derived from the analysis. Some of these developments also apply to other attribution methodologies and indeed to other problems in climate science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Oldenborgh","given":"Geert Jan","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Wiel","given":"Karin","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Kew","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Philip","given":"Sjoukje"},{"family":"Otto","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Vautard","given":"Robert"},{"family":"King","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Lott","given":"Fraser"},{"family":"Arrighi","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Roop"},{"family":"Aalst","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vanoldenborghPathwaysPitfallsExtreme2021","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-021-03071-7","ISSN":"1573-1480","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,10]]},"language":"en","page":"13","source":"Springer Link","title":"Pathways and pitfalls in extreme event attribution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03071-7","volume":"166"},

  {"id":"vaughanHollywoodDirtiestSecret2019","abstract":"In an era when many businesses have come under scrutiny for their environmental impact, the film industry has for the most part escaped criticism and regulation. Its practices are more diffuse; its final product, less tangible; and Hollywood has adopted public-relations strategies that portray it as environmentally conscious. In Hollywood’s Dirtiest Secret, Hunter Vaughan offers a new history of the movies from an environmental perspective, arguing that how we make and consume films has serious ecological consequences.Bringing together environmental humanities, science communication, and social ethics, Hollywood’s Dirtiest Secret is a pathbreaking consideration of the film industry’s environmental impact that examines how our cultural prioritization of spectacle has distracted us from its material consequences and natural-resource use. Vaughan examines the environmental effects of filmmaking from Hollywood classics to the digital era, considering how popular screen media shapes and reflects our understanding of the natural world. He recounts the production histories of major blockbusters—Gone with the Wind, Singin’ in the Rain, Twister, and Avatar—situating them in the contexts of the development of the film industry, popular environmentalism, and the proliferation of digital technologies. Emphasizing the materiality of media, Vaughan interweaves details of the hidden environmental consequences of specific filmmaking practices, from water use to server farms, within a larger critical portrait of social perceptions and valuations of the natural world.","author":[{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Hunter"}],"citation-key":"vaughanHollywoodDirtiestSecret2019","ISBN":"978-0-231-54415-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"page":"256 Pages","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Columbia University Press","title":"Hollywood's Dirtiest Secret: The Hidden Environmental Costs of the Movies","title-short":"Hollywood's Dirtiest Secret","type":"book"},

  {"id":"vijaykumarSocialMediaVirality2015","abstract":"Social media have transformed traditional configurations of how risk signals related to an infectious disease outbreak (IDO) are transmitted from public health authorities to the general public. However, our understanding of how social media might influence risk perceptions during these situations, and the influence of such processes on ensuing societal responses remains limited. This paper draws on key ideas from the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), Socially Mediated Crisis Communication (SMCC) model and a case study of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) social media management of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to propose a new conceptual model. The Risk Amplification through Media Spread (RAMS) model brings clarity to the new complexities in media management of IDOs by delineating the processes of message diffusion and risk amplification through communication channels that are often highly integrated due to social media. The model offers recommendations for communication priorities during different stages of an IDO. The paper concludes with a discussion of the RAMS model from theoretical and applied perspectives, and sets the direction for future conceptual refinement and empirical testing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vijaykumar","given":"Santosh"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Glen"}],"citation-key":"vijaykumarSocialMediaVirality2015","container-title":"Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management","DOI":"10.1515/jhsem-2014-0072","ISSN":"1547-7355, 2194-6361","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Media and the Virality of Risk: The Risk Amplification through Media Spread (RAMS) Model","title-short":"Social Media and the Virality of Risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jhsem.2015.12.issue-3/jhsem-2014-0072/jhsem-2014-0072.xml","volume":"12"},

Vipassana-Praxis ist ein Weg, um das durch Nichtsehen (avijjâ) und Verblendung (kilesa) verursachte Leiden (dukkha) zu überwinden bzw. im Leben die Befreiung des Nirwana zu erlangen. Er wird auf einen Kommentar (Visuddhi-Magga) zu den im Pali-Kanon überlieferten Lehrreden des historischen Buddha zurückgeführt.\nDie Vipassana-Praxis und das Erreichen ihrer Ziele ist grundsätzlich an keine Religionszugehörigkeit gebunden. Vipassana-Meditation wird auch von Nicht-Buddhisten geübt und gelehrt. Wesentlicher Teil der verschiedenen Schulungsmethoden ist die Übung von Achtsamkeit (sati). In der psychologischen Literatur wird Vipassana-Meditation gewöhnlich „Achtsamkeitsmeditation“ statt Einsichtsmeditation genannt.Die „Vipassana-Bewegung“ ist eine lose geknüpfte Laien- und Ordiniertenbewegung, die im Theravada-Buddhismus ihren Ursprung hat.

  {"id":"vogelSocioeconomicConditionsSatisfying2021a","abstract":"Meeting human needs at sustainable levels of energy use is fundamental for avoiding catastrophic climate change and securing the well-being of all people. In the current political-economic regime, no country does so. Here, we assess which socio-economic conditions might enable societies to satisfy human needs at low energy use, to reconcile human well-being with climate mitigation. Using a novel analytical framework alongside a novel multivariate regression-based moderation approach and data for 106 countries, we analyse how the relationship between energy use and six dimensions of human need satisfaction varies with a wide range of socio-economic factors relevant to the provisioning of goods and services ('provisioning factors'). We find that factors such as public service quality, income equality, democracy, and electricity access are associated with higher need satisfaction and lower energy requirements (‘beneficial provisioning factors’). Conversely, extractivism and economic growth beyond moderate levels of affluence are associated with lower need satisfaction and greater energy requirements (‘detrimental provisioning factors’). Our results suggest that improving beneficial provisioning factors and abandoning detrimental ones could enable countries to provide sufficient need satisfaction at much lower, ecologically sustainable levels of energy use. However, as key pillars of the required changes in provisioning run contrary to the dominant political-economic regime, a broader transformation of the economic system may be required to prioritise, and organise provisioning for, the satisfaction of human needs at low energy use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Vogel","given":"Jefim"},{"family":"Steinberger","given":"Julia K."},{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Lamb","given":"William F."},{"family":"Krishnakumar","given":"Jaya"}],"citation-key":"vogelSocioeconomicConditionsSatisfying2021a","container-title":"Global Environmental Change","container-title-short":"Global Environmental Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102287","ISSN":"0959-3780","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"language":"en","page":"102287","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Socio-economic conditions for satisfying human needs at low energy use: An international analysis of social provisioning","title-short":"Socio-economic conditions for satisfying human needs at low energy use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021000662"},

  {"id":"walkerRoleForestConversion2020","abstract":"Maintaining the abundance of carbon stored aboveground in Amazon forests is central to any comprehensive climate stabilization strategy. Growing evidence points to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) as buffers against large-scale carbon emissions across a nine-nation network of indigenous territories (ITs) and protected natural areas (PNAs). Previous studies have demonstrated a link between indigenous land management and avoided deforestation, yet few have accounted for forest degradation and natural disturbances—processes that occur without forest clearing but are increasingly important drivers of biomass loss. Here we provide a comprehensive accounting of aboveground carbon dynamics inside and outside Amazon protected lands. Using published data on changes in aboveground carbon density and forest cover, we track gains and losses in carbon density from forest conversion and degradation/disturbance. We find that ITs and PNAs stored more than one-half (58%; 41,991 MtC) of the region’s carbon in 2016 but were responsible for just 10% (−130 MtC) of the net change (−1,290 MtC). Nevertheless, nearly one-half billion tons of carbon were lost from both ITs and PNAs (−434 MtC and −423 MtC, respectively), with degradation/disturbance accounting for >75% of the losses in 7 countries. With deforestation increasing, and degradation/disturbance a neglected but significant source of region-wide emissions (47%), our results suggest that sustained support for IPLC stewardship of Amazon forests is critical. IPLCs provide a global environmental service that merits increased political protection and financial support, particularly if Amazon Basin countries are to achieve their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Wayne S."},{"family":"Gorelik","given":"Seth R."},{"family":"Baccini","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Aragon-Osejo","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"Josse","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Macedo","given":"Marcia N."},{"family":"Augusto","given":"Cicero"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Katan","given":"Tuntiak"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Alana Almeida","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cuellar","given":"Saul"},{"family":"Llanos","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Zager","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Mirabal","given":"Gregorio Díaz"},{"family":"Solvik","given":"Kylen K."},{"family":"Farina","given":"Mary K."},{"family":"Moutinho","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Schwartzman","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"walkerRoleForestConversion2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1913321117","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"3015-3025","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The role of forest conversion, degradation, and disturbance in the carbon dynamics of Amazon indigenous territories and protected areas","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913321117","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"warszawskiAllOptionsNot2021","abstract":"Climate science provides strong evidence of the necessity of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. The IPCC 1.5 °C special report (SR1.5) presents 414 emissions scenarios modelled for the report, of which around 50 are classified as ‘1.5 °C scenarios’, with no or low temperature overshoot. These emission scenarios differ in their reliance on individual mitigation levers, including reduction of global energy demand, decarbonisation of energy production, development of land-management systems, and the pace and scale of deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. The reliance of 1.5 °C scenarios on these levers needs to be critically assessed in light of the potentials of the relevant technologies and roll-out plans. We use a set of five parameters to bundle and characterise the mitigation levers employed in the SR1.5 1.5 °C scenarios. For each of these levers, we draw on the literature to define ‘medium’ and ‘high’ upper bounds that delineate between their ‘reasonable’, ‘challenging’ and ‘speculative’ use by mid century. We do not find any 1.5 °C scenarios that stay within all medium upper bounds on the five mitigation levers. Scenarios most frequently ‘over use’ CDR with geological storage as a mitigation lever, whilst reductions of energy demand and carbon intensity of energy production are ‘over used’ less frequently. If we allow mitigation levers to be employed up to our high upper bounds, we are left with 22 of the SR1.5 1.5 °C scenarios with no or low overshoot. The scenarios that fulfil these criteria are characterised by greater coverage of the available mitigation levers than those scenarios that exceed at least one of the high upper bounds. When excluding the two scenarios that exceed the SR1.5 carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, this subset of 1.5 °C scenarios shows a range of 15–22 Gt CO2 (16–22 Gt CO2 interquartile range) for emissions in 2030. For the year of reaching net zero CO2 emissions the range is 2039–2061 (2049–2057 interquartile range).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Warszawski","given":"Lila"},{"family":"Kriegler","given":"Elmar"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Gaffney","given":"Owen"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Klingenfeld","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Koide","given":"Ryu"},{"family":"Costa","given":"María Máñez"},{"family":"Messner","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Nakicenovic","given":"Nebojsa"},{"family":"Schellnhuber","given":"Hans Joachim"},{"family":"Schlosser","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Kazuhiko"},{"family":"Leeuw","given":"Sander Van Der"},{"family":"Whiteman","given":"Gail"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"warszawskiAllOptionsNot2021","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"westEastFaceHelicon1999","abstract":"Ever since Neolithic times Greek lands lay open to cultural imports from western Asia: agriculture, metal-working, writing, religious institutions, artistic fashions, musical instruments, and much more. Over the last sixty years scholars have increasingly become aware of links connecting earlyGreek poetry with the literatures of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Canaan, and Israel. Martin West's new book far surpasses previous studies in comprehensiveness, demonstrating these links with massive and detailed documentation and showing that they are much more fundamental and pervasive than hashitherto been acknowledged. His survey embraces Hesiod, the Homeric epics, the lyric poets, and Aeschylus, and concludes with an illuminating discussion of possible avenues of transmission between the orient and Greece. He believes that an age has dawned in which Hellenists will no more be able toignore the Near Eastern literature than Latinists can ignore Greek.","author":[{"family":"West","given":"Martin Litchfield"}],"citation-key":"westEastFaceHelicon1999","ISBN":"978-0-19-815221-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,4,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"694","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth","title-short":"The east face of Helicon","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wiedenhoferSystematicReviewEvidence2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              As long as economic growth is a major political goal, decoupling growth from resource use and emissions is a prerequisite for a sustainable net-zero emissions future. However, empirical evidence for absolute decoupling, i.e. decreasing resource use and emissions at the required scale despite continued economic growth, is scarce and scattered across different research streams. In this two-part systematic review, we assess how and to what extent decoupling has been observed and what can be learnt for addressing the sustainability and climate crisis. Based on a transparent approach, we systematically identify and screen more than 11 500 scientific papers, eventually analyzing full texts of 835 empirical studies on the relationship between economic growth (GDP), resource use (materials and energy) and greenhouse gas emissions. Part I of the review examines how decoupling has been investigated across three research streams: energy, materials and energy, and emissions. Part II synthesizes the empirical evidence and policy implications (Haberl\n              et al\n              2020\n              Environ. Res. Lett.\n              15\n              065003). In part I, we examine the topical, temporal and geographical scopes, methods of analysis, institutional networks and prevalent conceptual angles. We find that in this rapidly growing literature, the vast majority of studies—decomposition, ‘causality’ and Environmental Kuznets Curve analysis—approach the topic from a statistical-econometric point of view, while hardly acknowledging thermodynamic principles on the role of energy and materials for socio-economic activities. A potentially fundamental incompatibility between economic growth and systemic societal changes to address the climate crisis is rarely considered. We conclude that the existing wealth of empirical evidence merits braver conceptual advances than we have seen thus far. Future work should focus on comprehensive multi-indicator long-term analyses, conceptually grounded on the fundamental biophysical basis of socio-economic activities, incorporating the role of global supply chains as well as the wider societal role and preconditions of economic growth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiedenhofer","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Virág","given":"Doris"},{"family":"Kalt","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Plank","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Streeck","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Pichler","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Krausmann","given":"Fridolin"},{"family":"Brockway","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Schaffartzik","given":"Anke"},{"family":"Fishman","given":"Tomer"},{"family":"Hausknost","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Leon-Gruchalski","given":"Bartholomäus"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Tânia"},{"family":"Creutzig","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Haberl","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"wiedenhoferSystematicReviewEvidence2020","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"williamsNetworkAnalysisReveals2015","abstract":"Action to tackle the complex and divisive issue of climate change will be strongly inﬂuenced by public perception. Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to inﬂuence individual attitudes and behaviours – yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and ﬁnd that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised ‘‘sceptic’’ and ‘‘activist’’ groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also ﬁnd mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising ‘‘echo chambers’’, but also within ‘‘open forums’’, mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate. Our results have implications for public engagement with this important global challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Hywel T.P."},{"family":"McMurray","given":"James R."},{"family":"Kurz","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Hugo Lambert","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"williamsNetworkAnalysisReveals2015","container-title":"Global Environmental Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.03.006","ISSN":"09593780","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5]]},"language":"en","page":"126-138","source":"Crossref","title":"Network analysis reveals open forums and echo chambers in social media discussions of climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959378015000369","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"willigesFairnessCriticallyConditions2022","abstract":"Countries’ nationally determined contributions to mitigate global warming translate to claims of country specific shares of the remaining carbon budget. The remaining global budget is limited by the aim of staying well below 2 °C, however. Here we show how fairness concerns quantitatively condition the allocation of this global carbon budget across countries. Minimal fairness requirements include securing basic needs, attributing historical responsibility for past emissions, accounting for benefits from past emissions, and not exceeding countries’ societally feasible emission reduction rate. The argument in favor of taking into account these fairness concerns reflects a critique of both simple equality- and sovereignty-principled reduction approaches, the former modelled here as the equal-per-capita distribution from now on, the latter as prolonging the inequality of the status-quo levels of emissions into the transformation period (considered a form of “grandfathering”). We find the option most in line with fairness concerns to be a four-fold qualified version of the equal-per-capita approach that incorporates a limited form of grandfathering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Williges","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Lukas H."},{"family":"Steininger","given":"Karl W."},{"family":"Kirchengast","given":"Gottfried"}],"citation-key":"willigesFairnessCriticallyConditions2022","container-title":"Global Environmental Change","container-title-short":"Global Environmental Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102481","ISSN":"0959-3780","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102481","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fairness critically conditions the carbon budget allocation across countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937802200019X","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"winkelmannSocialTippingProcesses2022","abstract":"Societal transformations are necessary to address critical global challenges, such as mitigation of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable development goals. Recently, social tipping processes have received increased attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social tipping processes with respect to technological and energy systems, political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and behaviors have been suggested as potential key drivers towards climate action. Drawing from expert insights and comprehensive literature review, we develop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes critical to facilitating rapid social transformations. We find that social tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human agency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal scales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those processes that could be decisive for future trajectories towards climate action. We illustrate this definition with the European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes, highlighting the prospective role of the FridaysForFuture movement. Accordingly, this conceptual framework for social tipping processes can be utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change mitigation policies and actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Winkelmann","given":"Ricarda"},{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."},{"family":"Smith","given":"E.

  {"id":"wittenbrink2005understanding","abstract":"\"RSS and Atom are the most widely used of many content syndication formats that have developed over the last few years to address the need to distribute and receive streams of content from websites and applications. Sites syndicate content for a broad variety of reasons, from replacing email as a medium for outbound contact to updating satellite sites. Each format has evolved to meet the changing needs of its driving community. All the common formats use a specific XML vocabulary to structure a stream of content in an easily consumable format. This book helps you understand and use all the features provided by Report Studio to generate impressive deliverables. It will take you from being a beginner to a professional report author. It bridges the gap between basic training provided by manuals or trainers and the practical techniques learned over years of practice. This is a concise yet comprehensive guide to feeds and syndication for content professionals, web developers and marketing teams who want to understand what RSS and content syndication is, how it works, what it can for them, and how they can get it up and running. The feed formats and vocabularies are covered in depth, and the book does require some familiarity with XML, but no scripting or development expertise is necessary.\"--Resource description p.","author":[{"family":"Wittenbrink","given":"Heinz"}],"citation-key":"wittenbrink2005understanding","ISBN":"‎ 1904811574","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"publisher":"Packt Publishing Ltd.","title":"RSS and Atom understanding and implementing content feeds and syndication","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wittenbrinkChildrenRevolution2007","abstract":"Having grown up in Germany’s Ruhr Valley, Heinz Wittenbrink has been living in Styria for just over two years. As a student, he concentrated on German literature, philosophy and art history; but he ended up in the field of new media. For example, as project director for the Bertelsmann Group. Brought up a devout Catholic, he married a teacher of Protestant religion. His professional focus is HTML, but his private delights are the Roman Baroque and his garden, where he spends a great deal of time. The professor of new media at the Johanneum in Graz moves in diverse worlds. An ideal breeding ground for thinking about the future. Among the kettles and dirty cutlery in the university’s staff lounge, we discuss where life, work and education are heading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2008,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wittenbrink","given":"Heinz"}],"citation-key":"wittenbrinkChildrenRevolution2007","container-title":"Conceptions of the Desirable","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"82-84","source":"SpringerLink","title":"The Children of the Revolution","type":"chapter","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-211-71260-3_20"},

  {"id":"woodwardIncrementumAdAbsurdum2015","abstract":"The paper seeks to assess the timeframe for eradication of poverty, defined by poverty lines of $1.25 and $5 per person per day at 2005 purchasing power parity, if pre-crisis (1993-2008) patterns of income growth were maintained indefinitely, taking account of the differential performance of China. On the basis of optimistic assumptions, and implicitly assuming an indefinite continuation of potentially important pro-poor shifts in development policies during the baseline period, it finds that eradication will take at least 100 years at $1.25-a-day, and 200 years at $5-a-day. While this could in principle be brought forward by accelerating global growth, global carbon constraints raise serious doubts about the viability of this course, particularly as global GDP would need to exceed $100,000 per capita at $1.25-a-day, and $1m per capita at $5-a-day. The clear implication is that poverty eradication, even at $1.25-a-day, and especially at a poverty line which better reflects the satisfaction of basic needs, can be reconciled with global carbon constraints only by a major increase in the share of the poorest in global economic growth, far beyond what can realistically be achieved by existing instruments of development policy – that is, by effective measures to reduce global inequality.","author":[{"family":"Woodward","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"woodwardIncrementumAdAbsurdum2015","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"Incrementum ad Absurdum: Global Growth, Inequality and Poverty Eradication in a Carbon-Constrained World","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"zalasiewiczAnthropocene2015","abstract":"The Anthropocene hypothesis—that humans have impacted “the environment” but also changed the Earth’s geology—has spread widely through the sciences and humanities. This hypothesis is being currently tested to see whether the Anthropocene may become part of the Geological Time Scale. An Anthropocene Working Group has been established to assemble the evidence. The decision regarding formalization is likely to be taken in the next few years, by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the body that oversees the Geological Time Scale. Whichever way the decision goes, there will remain the reality of the phenomenon and the utility of the concept.\n            The evidence, as outlined here, rests upon a broad range of signatures reflecting humanity’s significant and increasing modification of Earth systems. These may be visible as markers in physical deposits in the form of the greatest expansion of novel minerals in the last 2.4 billion years of Earth history and development of ubiquitous materials, such as plastics, unique to the Anthropocene. The artefacts we produce to live as modern humans will form the technofossils of the future. Human-generated deposits now extend from our natural habitat on land into our oceans, transported at rates exceeding the sediment carried by rivers by an order of magnitude. That influence now extends increasingly underground in our quest for minerals, fuel, living space, and to develop transport and communication networks. These human trace fossils may be preserved over geological durations and the evolution of technology has created a new technosphere, yet to evolve into balance with other Earth systems.\n            The expression of the Anthropocene can be seen in sediments and glaciers in chemical markers. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by ~45 percent above pre–Industrial Revolution levels, mainly through combustion, over a few decades, of a geological carbon-store that took many millions of years to accumulate. Although this may ultimately drive climate change, average global temperature increases and resultant sea-level rises remain comparatively small, as yet. But the shift to isotopically lighter carbon locked into limestones and calcareous fossils will form a permanent record. Nitrogen and phosphorus contents in surface soils have approximately doubled through increased use of fertilizers to increase agricultural yields as the human population has also doubled in the last 50 years. Industrial metals, radioactive fallout from atomic weapons testing, and complex organic compounds have been widely dispersed through the environment and become preserved in sediment and ice layers.\n            Despite radical changes to flora and fauna across the planet, the Earth still has most of its complement of biological species. However, current trends of habitat loss and predation may push the Earth into the sixth mass extinction event in the next few centuries.

Damit lagen die Emissionen um rd. 0,6 % über dem Wert von 1990. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr 2017 sanken die Treibhausgas-Emissionen um 3,7 %. Hauptverantwortlich für den Rückgang waren die wartungsbedingte Stilllegung eines großen Hochofens sowie die niedrigere Stromerzeugung aus Erdgas.\nDie Wirtschaftssektoren, die nicht dem Europäischen Emissionshandel unterliegen, emittierten im Jahr 2018 50,5 Mio. Tonnen CO2-Äquivalent. Damit lagen diese Treibhausgas-Emissionen um 1,6 Mio. Tonnen über der nationalen Emissionshöchstmenge für 2018.\nDie Einhaltung des nationalen Zieles bis 2020 ist dennoch wahrscheinlich, da aus den Vorjahren nicht verbrauchte Emissionsrechte zur Verfügung stehen. Für die Klimaziele bis 2030 und 2050 ist eine konsequente Emissionsreduktion in allen Sektoren unerlässlich.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Zechmeister","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Anderl","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gugele","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Gössl","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Haider","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Heller","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Köther","given":"Traute"},{"family":"Krutzler","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kuschel","given":"Verena"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Neier","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Pazdernik","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Perl","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Poupa","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Purzner","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Rigler","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Schieder","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Günther"},{"family":"Schodl","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Storch","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Stranner","given":"Gudrun"},{"family":"Vogel","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Wiesenberger","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"zechmeisterKlimaschutzbericht20202020","event-place":"Wien","ISBN":"978-3-99004-558-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher-place":"Wien","title":"Klimaschutzbericht 2020","type":"book","URL":"https://www.umweltbundesamt.at/fileadmin/site/publikationen/rep0738.pdf"},

  {"id":"zuboffAgeSurveillanceCapitalism2019","abstract":"The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called \"surveillance capitalism,\" and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control us. The heady optimism of the Internet's early days is gone. Technologies that were meant to liberate us have deepened inequality and stoked divisions. Tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder, whether government or retailer. Profits now depend not only on predicting our behaviour but modifying it too. How will this fusion of capitalism and the digital shape our values and define our future? Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads. We still have the power to decide what kind of world we want to live in, and what we decide now will shape the rest of the century. Our choices: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a deeply-reasoned examination of the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic oversight. As it explores this new capitalism's impact on society, politics, business, and technology, it exposes the struggles that will decide both the next chapter of capitalism and the meaning of information civilization. Most critically, it shows how we can protect ourselves and our communities and ensure we are the masters of the digital rather than its slaves","author":[{"family":"Zuboff","given":"Shoshana"}],"citation-key":"zuboffAgeSurveillanceCapitalism2019","edition":"Paperback edition","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78283-274-4 978-1-78125-685-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"691","publisher":"Profile Books","publisher-place":"London","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The age of surveillance capitalism: the fight for a human future at the new frontier of power","title-short":"The age of surveillance capitalism","type":"book"},
